### Concepts and Deep Explanations:

#### 1. **Project Setup:**
   - **Addition.py:** You created an `addition.py` file inside the `src` folder, which contains a simple addition function. This function takes two variables as input and returns their sum. 
   - **Unit Testing:** You included unit testing in the `addition.py` file to verify the functionality of the addition function. Unit tests are used to ensure that the individual components of your code are working correctly.
   
   **Purpose:** This setup is part of a pipeline to ensure that the addition function works as expected, and that GitHub Actions will automatically run tests when changes are made to the code.

   ```python
   # addition.py
   def add(x, y):
       return x + y
   
   # Test the function
   assert add(2, 3) == 5
   ```

#### 2. **GitHub Action Pipeline Setup:**
   - You create a pipeline using GitHub Actions that triggers whenever a new commit is made. The pipeline automates tasks such as checking out the code, setting up the environment, and running tests.

   **Command (Example of Commit):**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "This is a test commit"
   ```

   **Purpose:** The commit triggers the pipeline, where GitHub Actions takes over to automate the rest of the process. This is useful for continuous integration (CI), where code changes are automatically tested without manual intervention.

#### 3. **Job Setup in GitHub Actions:**
   - **Set Up Job:** GitHub Actions first sets up the job, then checks out the code. This is achieved using the `actions/checkout@v3` plugin.
   - **Check Out Code:** This plugin retrieves your repository's latest code and prepares it for further actions.
   
   **Purpose:** The job setup and checkout are fundamental in the CI/CD process, where the code must be retrieved and prepared for the next steps, such as testing or building.

   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout Code
     uses: actions/checkout@v3
   ```

#### 4. **Setting up Python in the Pipeline:**
   - After checking out the code, the environment is configured using `setup-python@v2`. This sets up the Python environment in an Ubuntu container (or any specified image).
   - **Python Versions:** You are using both Python 3.8 and 3.9. This can be extended to multiple Python versions for compatibility testing.
   
   **Purpose:** Setting up Python environments ensures the tests are run under the right conditions. Different versions of Python can be used to ensure that the code works consistently across various versions.

   ```yaml
   - name: Set up Python
     uses: actions/setup-python@v2
     with:
       python-version: '3.8'
   ```

#### 5. **Install Dependencies and Run Tests:**
   - You install necessary dependencies (e.g., `pip`, `pytest`), even though your project doesn’t currently have any. Finally, the tests are executed using `pytest`.
   
   **Purpose:** Installing dependencies ensures that your Python code has all the necessary packages and tools to run. The test step ensures that the code changes haven’t broken any functionality.
   
   **Command (Example of Running Tests):**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   **Example YAML for Installing Dependencies and Running Tests:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: |
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip
       pip install pytest

   - name: Run tests
     run: pytest
   ```

#### 6. **GitHub Action Plugins:**
   - GitHub Actions provides a Marketplace of plugins, such as `actions/checkout@v3` and `setup-python@v2`. You don't need to install them manually as in Jenkins, where plugins have to be managed in the system. Plugins in GitHub Actions are integrated directly via your YAML file.

   **Purpose:** Using plugins simplifies the CI/CD setup, reducing the complexity of managing external dependencies like in Jenkins. You can easily switch plugins for different environments (e.g., Java, Node.js, Ruby, etc.).

   **Example of Python Setup:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Set up Python environment
     uses: actions/setup-python@v2
   ```

#### 7. **Advantages and Limitations of GitHub Actions:**
   - **Advantages:**
     - Less code is required to configure CI/CD pipelines.
     - Plugins are auto-installed, and there’s less manual setup involved compared to Jenkins.
     - GitHub Actions integrates tightly with GitHub repositories.
   
   - **Limitations:**
     - Limited scope compared to older tools like Jenkins.
     - Since GitHub Actions is relatively new, its plugins and ecosystem may not be as extensive.
     - Platform dependency: Moving from GitHub to other platforms (like AWS CodeCommit or Azure DevOps) can be difficult if you're heavily reliant on GitHub-specific features.

   **Purpose:** Understanding the pros and cons helps in deciding whether to adopt GitHub Actions or stick with more mature tools like Jenkins.

#### 8. **Custom Runners in GitHub Actions:**
   - GitHub Actions allows you to set up custom self-hosted runners. If the default runners provided by GitHub are not sufficient for your use case (e.g., if you need more compute resources for heavy tests), you can create and configure your own runners.
   
   **Purpose:** Custom runners are useful for scenarios where you need more control over the environment or when security is a concern, and you don’t want to use the shared GitHub runners.

   **Setting Up Custom Runner:**
   ```yaml
   - name: Use self-hosted runner
     runs-on: self-hosted
   ```

#### 9. **Secrets Management:**
   - GitHub Actions provides native support for managing secrets, such as storing sensitive information like API tokens, passwords, or Kubernetes config files (`kubeconfig`).
   - These secrets can be securely stored and used in the pipeline without exposing them in the codebase.

   **Purpose:** Secrets management is essential to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in the pipeline logs or code. Using this feature securely stores and accesses credentials when necessary.

   **Example (Using Secrets in GitHub Actions):**
   ```yaml
   - name: Set up Kubernetes
     run: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     env:
       KUBECONFIG: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}
   ```

#### 10. **Comparing GitHub Actions with Jenkins:**
   - **GitHub Actions:**
     - Easier setup with auto-installed plugins.
     - Integrated tightly with GitHub.
     - Limited to GitHub as a platform.
   
   - **Jenkins:**
     - More flexible and mature.
     - Requires manual installation and setup of plugins.
     - Can be hosted on any platform, with more control over worker nodes.

   **Purpose:** When choosing between GitHub Actions and Jenkins, consider your project requirements, platform, and the level of control and flexibility you need. GitHub Actions is ideal for GitHub repositories and smaller CI/CD needs, while Jenkins provides more extensive features for complex projects.

#### Conclusion:
   - You’ve created a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which automatically checks out your code, sets up a Python environment, and runs unit tests after every commit.
   - The power of GitHub Actions lies in its simplicity and tight integration with GitHub, although it has limitations in terms of flexibility and scope compared to Jenkins.

### 1. **Basic Python Program and Unit Testing:**
   - **File Structure:**
     - Inside the `src` folder, there's a `addition.py` file that contains a simple addition function and corresponding unit test.
     - **Code Example:**
       ```python
       # addition.py
       def add(a, b):
           return a + b
       
       # Test
       def test_add():
           assert add(2, 3) == 5
       ```
     - **Scenario**: You want to test this simple function to verify correctness.
     - **Purpose**: This ensures that any changes made to the code don’t break its core functionality.
     - **Command**: To run the unit tests locally:
       ```bash
       pytest addition.py
       ```

### 2. **What is GitHub Actions?**
   - **GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub. It allows you to automate, build, test, and deploy your code whenever there's a push or pull request.
   - **Example Pipeline Flow**:
     - **Trigger**: A GitHub Action is triggered on every commit.
     - **Checkout Code**: Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to pull the code from the repository.
     - **Setup Python Environment**: A Python environment is created for running the code and tests using `setup-python@v2`.
     - **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary Python packages.
     - **Run Tests**: Use `pytest` to execute tests and verify the code.

---

### 3. **Running the GitHub Actions Pipeline:**
   - **Example of Running a Pipeline**:
     1. **Make a Commit**: 
        - You make a simple change to the code, e.g., add a comment.
        - **Scenario**: When a change is committed, GitHub Action automatically triggers and starts executing the CI pipeline.
     2. **What Happens**:
        - **Checkout Code**: Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to get the latest code.
        - **Setup Python Environment**: Configures Python using `setup-python@v2`.
        - **Run Tests**: Executes the `pytest` command to run tests.
     3. **Result**: If all steps pass, the pipeline is successful.
   
   - **Command Output Example**:
     - Checking out the code:
       ```
       Run actions/checkout@v3
       Checking out repository code...
       ```
     - Setting up Python:
       ```
       Setup Python 3.8
       ```
     - Running tests:
       ```
       Run pytest
       =================== test session starts =====================
       tests/test_add.py .....
       =================== 5 passed in 0.10s ========================
       ```

### 4. **Writing a GitHub Actions Workflow (YAML File)**:
   - **Pipeline Structure**:
     - A GitHub Actions pipeline is defined using YAML, similar to Kubernetes or Jenkins configuration.
     - **Example YAML**:
       ```yaml
       name: Python Test
       
       on:
         push:
           branches:
             - main

       jobs:
         build:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest

           strategy:
             matrix:
               python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

           steps:
           - name: Checkout code
             uses: actions/checkout@v3

           - name: Set up Python
             uses: actions/setup-python@v2
             with:
               python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

           - name: Install dependencies
             run: pip install pytest

           - name: Run tests
             run: pytest
       ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - **Matrix**: The code will be tested on both Python 3.8 and 3.9.
     - **Steps**:
       - Checkout code.
       - Set up the Python environment.
       - Install any dependencies.
       - Run tests with `pytest`.

---

### 5. **GitHub Actions Marketplace and Plugins**:
   - **Plugins**: GitHub Actions provides a marketplace where you can find and use predefined actions (plugins) like `actions/checkout@v3` for checking out code or `actions/setup-python@v2` for setting up Python.
   - **Command**: No installation is needed; simply reference the plugin in your `.yml` file.
   - **Scenario**: GitHub Actions make it easy to integrate without manually configuring tools. This reduces code complexity and setup time.

---

### 6. **Custom Runners in GitHub Actions**:
   - **Runners**: By default, GitHub Actions uses shared runners (virtual machines) to execute your jobs. You can also create **self-hosted runners** for more control.
     - **Scenario**: If you need more compute power, or if GitHub’s shared runners don’t meet your requirements (e.g., for heavy workloads or security reasons), you can create and use your own infrastructure.
     - **Command**: To create a self-hosted runner, you can configure it in the GitHub settings under **Actions** → **Runners**.
   
---

### 7. **Secrets Management in GitHub Actions**:
   - **Purpose**: When deploying applications, you'll often need to store sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and configuration files (e.g., Kubernetes kubeconfig).
   - **Scenario**: Storing these securely using GitHub’s **Secrets** feature ensures they’re not exposed in your codebase.
   - **Command**:
     - Store a secret via the GitHub UI: Settings → Secrets → Actions.
     - Reference it in your workflow:
       ```yaml
       env:
         KUBECONFIG: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}
       ```

---

### 8. **Comparison with Jenkins**:
   - **Hosting**: Jenkins requires you to manage infrastructure (e.g., EC2 instances, plugins), whereas GitHub Actions is hosted by GitHub.
   - **User Interface**: GitHub Actions provides a simpler UI and less configuration than Jenkins.
   - **Cost**: GitHub Actions offers free execution for public repositories and limited execution minutes for private ones.
   - **Scenario**: For open-source projects or GitHub-exclusive environments, GitHub Actions is preferable due to lower maintenance overhead.

---

### 9. **Pros and Cons of GitHub Actions**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Minimal maintenance (GitHub hosts and manages it).
     - Easy to use and integrates directly with GitHub repositories.
     - Free for public repositories.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited scope compared to Jenkins, especially in large enterprise settings.
     - Platform-dependent (you’re locked into GitHub).

---

### 10. **Conclusion**:
   - If your project is small, open-source, and hosted on GitHub, **GitHub Actions** is an excellent tool due to its simplicity and tight integration.
   - For enterprise-grade systems with heavy customization or when using other platforms (AWS, Azure), you may prefer Jenkins or another CI/CD tool.
