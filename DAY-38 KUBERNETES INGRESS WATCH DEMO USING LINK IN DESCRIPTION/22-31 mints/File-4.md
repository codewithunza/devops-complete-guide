     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: Ingress
     metadata:
       name: example-ingress
       annotations:
         nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
     spec:
       rules:
       - host: food.bar.com
         http:
           paths:
           - path: /bar
             pathType: Prefix
             backend:
               service:
                 name: my-service
                 port:
                   number: 80
 ```
   - **Modifications**:
     - **Host**: Changed from `example.com` to `food.bar.com`.
     - **Path**: Set to `/bar` to route traffic hitting `food.bar.com/bar` to `my-service`.
   
3. **Apply the Ingress Resource**
 ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Deploys the Ingress resource to the Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Expected Output**:
 ```
     ingress.networking.k8s.io/example-ingress created
 ```
   
4. **Verify the Ingress Creation**
 ```bash
   kubectl get ingress
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Lists all Ingress resources in the current namespace.
   - **Expected Output**:
 ```
     NAME             CLASS    HOSTS         ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
     example-ingress  <none>   food.bar.com  <none>    80      2m
 ```
   
### **Scenario and Purpose**
- **Scenario**: You have multiple services (e.g., `service1`, `service2`) and want to expose them under different subdomains or paths without creating separate LoadBalancer services for each.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates efficient traffic management and reduces the number of required external IP addresses by leveraging host-based routing.

---

## **5. Understanding Host-Based Load Balancing**

### **Concept Overview**
Host-based load balancing directs incoming traffic to different backend services based on the hostname specified in the request. For example, requests to `food.bar.com/bar` can be routed to `service1`, while `food.bar.com/baz` routes to `service2`.

### **Purpose**
- **Flexible Routing**: Allows differentiation of traffic based on the requested domain or subdomain.
- **Resource Optimization**: Enables multiple services to be exposed through a single Ingress controller and IP address.
- **Enhanced Organization**: Simplifies domain management by associating specific services with corresponding subdomains or paths.

### **Example Scenario**
- **Before Ingress**: Each service required its own LoadBalancer and external IP, leading to higher costs and complex configurations.
- **After Ingress**: A single Ingress controller handles routing based on hostnames, reducing the number of external IPs and simplifying access patterns.

     example-ingress  <none>   food.bar.com  <none>    80      2m
 ```
   - **Observation**: The `ADDRESS` field is `<none>`, indicating that no Ingress controller has processed the Ingress yet.

3. **Attempt to Access the Service via Ingress**
 ```bash
   curl http://food.bar.com/bar
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Attempts to access the service through the defined Ingress route.
   - **Expected Output**:
 ```
     curl: (6) Could not resolve host: food.bar.com
 ```
   - **Reason**: The Ingress controller is not yet deployed, so the Ingress rules are not being enforced.

   - **Purpose**: The theory provides the foundation on which practical skills are built. In an interview, you may be asked about the underlying principles of Kubernetes, so having a strong theoretical understanding is key.

### 2. **Checking Kubernetes State**
   - **Concept**: Before making any changes or deploying new resources, it's important to check the current state of your Kubernetes cluster. This involves verifying the status of Pods and Services.
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     kubectl get pods
 ```
     - **Output**: Lists all Pods running in the cluster, including their status.
 ```bash
     kubectl get svc
 ```
     - **Output**: Lists all Services running in the cluster, including their status.
   - **Purpose**: By running these commands, you can confirm that your deployments and services from previous sessions are still active and functioning as expected.

### 3. **Accessing a Service**
   - **Concept**: After deploying a Service, it's essential to verify that it is accessible. If a Service is of type `NodePort`, it exposes the application on a specific port of the node‚Äôs IP address.
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     minikube ip
 ```
     - **Output**: Returns the IP address of the Minikube cluster.
 ```bash
     curl http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>
 ```
     - **Output**: Should return the output from the application running inside the Pod, indicating that the Service is working correctly.
   - **Purpose**: This step verifies that the Service is properly routing traffic to the Pods and that the application is accessible.

### 4. **Creating an Ingress Resource**
   - **Concept**: An **Ingress** is a resource in Kubernetes that manages external access to services, typically HTTP. It can provide functionalities like host-based or path-based routing.
   - **Scenario**: In the example, we create an Ingress that routes traffic based on the host name `foo.bar.com` and the path `/bar`.
   - **Command**:
 ```yaml
     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: Ingress
     metadata:
       name: my-ingress
     spec:
       rules:
       - host: foo.bar.com
         http:
           paths:
           - path: /bar
             pathType: Prefix
             backend:
               service:
                 name: my-service
                 port:
                   number: 80
 ```
     - **Purpose**: This Ingress configuration routes traffic to the `my-service` service when the request is made to `foo.bar.com/bar`.

### 5. **Deploying the Ingress Resource**
   - **Concept**: After creating the Ingress YAML file, it must be applied to the Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
 ```
     - **Output**: The Ingress resource is created, but you might notice that the address field is empty, meaning it‚Äôs not yet functional.
   - **Purpose**: The Ingress resource is now in the cluster, but without an Ingress Controller, it won't route traffic as expected.

### 6. **Installing an Ingress Controller**
   - **Concept**: An **Ingress Controller** is a component that fulfills the rules defined in an Ingress resource. Without an Ingress Controller, the Ingress resource alone cannot function.
   - **Scenario**: Installing the NGINX Ingress Controller in Minikube, which is a popular and lightweight option.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     minikube addons enable ingress
 ```
     - **Output**: Enables the NGINX Ingress Controller on your Minikube cluster.
   - **Purpose**: The Ingress Controller will now watch for Ingress resources and route traffic accordingly.

### 7. **Testing the Ingress Configuration**
   - **Concept**: After the Ingress Controller is installed, test if the Ingress resource works as expected.
   - **Scenario**: You can test by making an HTTP request to the domain specified in the Ingress resource (`foo.bar.com/bar`).
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     curl http://foo.bar.com/bar
 ```
     - **Output**: If everything is configured correctly, this command should return the response from the `my-service` service.
   - **Purpose**: Verifies that the Ingress Controller is correctly routing traffic based on the Ingress resource‚Äôs rules.

### 8. **Choosing an Ingress Controller for Production**
   - **Concept**: In a production environment, you might not use Minikube but instead deploy on a more robust platform like EKS, OpenShift, or GKE. The process of installing an Ingress Controller may vary depending on the platform.
   - **Scenario**: The documentation for each Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, HAProxy) provides specific instructions for deployment in various environments.
   - **Purpose**: Ensure you select and deploy the appropriate Ingress Controller based on your production environment‚Äôs requirements and constraints.

### 9. **Understanding and Following Documentation**
   - **Concept**: Kubernetes and its ecosystem are vast, and the official documentation is an invaluable resource. It provides examples, best practices, and installation steps for various components.
   - **Purpose**: Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date and accurate information, especially when installing complex components like Ingress Controllers.

This detailed explanation covers the theoretical concepts, practical steps, and their significance in a Kubernetes environment. It also highlights the importance of understanding the theory behind Kubernetes operations, especially for interviews.
