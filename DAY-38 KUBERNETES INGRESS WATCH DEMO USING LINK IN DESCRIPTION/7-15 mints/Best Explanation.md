Let's break this down step by step to fully understand the problem and how Ingress solves it:

### Problem 1: Lack of Enterprise-Level Load Balancing in Kubernetes Services

Kubernetes is a powerful system for managing containerized applications, but the **basic service** that Kubernetes provides for exposing your applications initially lacked several important features that are crucial in **enterprise-level** web traffic management. Let's go deeper into why this was a problem.

#### 1. **Path-Based Routing**

- **What it is**: Path-based routing allows traffic to be routed to different services based on the specific URL path. For example, you might want requests to `/api` to go to one service and requests to `/admin` to go to a different service.
  
- **Why it matters**: In large, enterprise-level applications, you often have multiple microservices handling different parts of your application (e.g., an API service, a frontend service, a backend service). Without path-based routing, all traffic would be sent to the same service, which would require extra work to manually route traffic internally.

- **Before Ingress**: Kubernetes services couldn't handle path-based routing natively. You could expose your services, but you had no fine-grained control over how traffic was directed based on the URL path.

- **With Ingress**: Ingress allows you to define rules for how traffic should be routed based on the **path** of the incoming request. For example:
  - Requests to `example.com/api` can be routed to the API service.
  - Requests to `example.com/blog` can be routed to the blogging service.
  
  This makes it much easier to manage complex applications that have multiple services, each responsible for different parts of the app.

#### 2. **Host-Based Routing**

- **What it is**: Host-based routing allows traffic to be routed to different services based on the domain or subdomain in the request. For example, you might want traffic coming to `api.example.com` to go to the API service, while traffic to `www.example.com` goes to the web frontend service.

- **Why it matters**: Many enterprise-level applications use multiple subdomains for different services. For example, an e-commerce platform might have `shop.example.com` for the storefront and `admin.example.com` for the admin dashboard. Without host-based routing, all traffic would be routed to the same service, which limits flexibility.

- **Before Ingress**: Kubernetes services didn’t have the capability to route based on the **host**. You could expose services using `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`, but there was no way to define rules that route traffic based on the domain name.

- **With Ingress**: Ingress allows you to route traffic based on the **host** or domain name. This means you can easily handle multiple subdomains within the same Kubernetes cluster. For example:
  - Traffic to `shop.example.com` goes to the shopping service.
  - Traffic to `admin.example.com` goes to the admin service.

  This is essential for companies that have a lot of different domains or subdomains in use, and want to manage them efficiently within a single Kubernetes environment.

#### 3. **Sticky Sessions**

- **What it is**: Sticky sessions, also known as **session persistence**, means that once a user connects to a particular backend service, all future requests from that user are routed to the same service. This is crucial when you have stateful applications (like a shopping cart in e-commerce) where you need to maintain session information between requests.

- **Why it matters**: In many enterprise applications, you need sticky sessions to ensure that a user’s session stays consistent. For example, when a customer is shopping on an e-commerce site, you don’t want them to be directed to a different backend server with each request, as that could result in their shopping cart being lost.

- **Before Ingress**: Kubernetes services use simple round-robin load balancing, which means traffic is distributed equally among all available pods. This is great for stateless applications but problematic for applications that need sticky sessions.

- **With Ingress**: Ingress allows you to enable sticky sessions by setting session affinity rules. This ensures that once a user connects to a specific pod, they stay connected to that pod throughout their session. This is essential for stateful applications like e-commerce, user dashboards, or any application where session state needs to be maintained.

#### 4. **TLS Termination**

- **What it is**: TLS (Transport Layer Security) termination is the process of decrypting HTTPS traffic at a load balancer or proxy before forwarding it to backend services. This allows secure communication between the client (browser) and the server, but once the traffic reaches the internal network, it is passed as unencrypted HTTP.

- **Why it matters**: Enterprises need to ensure that all communication between the client and the server is secure, especially when handling sensitive data like user information, payment details, or personal data. TLS termination allows you to handle SSL/TLS certificates in a centralized manner, making it easier to manage security for multiple services.

- **Before Ingress**: Kubernetes services had no built-in way to handle TLS termination. You would need to set up external load balancers or proxies (like NGINX or HAProxy) manually to handle HTTPS traffic and terminate the SSL connection.

- **With Ingress**: Ingress can be configured to handle **TLS termination** natively. This means that you can set up HTTPS for your services by defining Ingress rules that manage certificates and encryption. Ingress will decrypt the traffic and forward it to your services over HTTP, which simplifies the process of securing your application.

### Summary of the Problem

Without Ingress, Kubernetes services were limited to simple round-robin load balancing and lacked important features that are essential for managing large-scale, complex, and secure applications. These missing features made it difficult for enterprises to use Kubernetes for mission-critical applications that require:

- Advanced traffic routing (path-based and host-based).
- Secure HTTPS connections (TLS termination).
- Session persistence (sticky sessions).

### How Ingress Solves the Problem

Ingress acts as a powerful gateway that sits in front of your Kubernetes services. It provides the missing features by:

1. **Routing traffic** based on paths (`/api`, `/shop`, etc.) and hosts (`shop.example.com`, `api.example.com`).
2. **Managing security** by handling TLS termination and making it easier to set up secure HTTPS connections.
3. **Enabling sticky sessions**, which are necessary for many stateful enterprise applications.
4. **Simplifying the architecture** by consolidating complex traffic management into a single, centralized resource (Ingress), rather than relying on external load balancers or proxies.

With these features, Kubernetes becomes far more capable of handling enterprise-level traffic management, making it suitable for production environments in large organizations.
