Let's break down and extract each concept, command, and scenario from the provided text while providing detailed explanations and the purpose of each step, as well as the expected output from the commands.

---

### 1. **Expose Prometheus Server to View its API**

**Command:**
```bash
kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --name=prometheus-server-ext
```
**Explanation:**  
The purpose of this command is to change the service type of Prometheus from `ClusterIP` (internal access only) to `NodePort` (external access). By doing this, you can access the Prometheus UI and API from outside the Kubernetes cluster using the node's IP address and the specified port.

- **Scenario:** You want to access the Prometheus dashboard or its API to visualize metrics.
- **Output:**
```bash
service/prometheus-server-ext exposed
```
After running this command, you can verify the service:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```
Expected output:
```bash
NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
prometheus-server          ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        80/TCP            10m
prometheus-server-ext      NodePort    10.96.0.2       <none>        80:31110/TCP      1m
```

### 2. **Accessing the Prometheus UI via NodePort**

**Command:**
```bash
minikube ip
```
This command retrieves the IP address of the Minikube node.

- **Scenario:** You need the Minikube node's IP address to access the Prometheus dashboard externally.
- **Expected Output:**
```bash
192.168.49.2
```

Now, access the Prometheus UI by opening a browser and navigating to:
```
http://<minikube-ip>:31110
```
Example: `http://192.168.49.2:31110`

---

### 3. **Using Prometheus Queries**

**Explanation:**
Once you have access to the Prometheus UI, you can run Prometheus queries to retrieve specific metrics about your Kubernetes cluster. By default, Prometheus only exposes metrics about the Kubernetes API server and built-in components (like pods, deployments, etc.).

- **Scenario:** You want to monitor the health of a custom application or track specific metrics not exposed by the default API.
- **Solution:** Developers can expose custom metrics using Prometheus libraries and provide those metrics via an endpoint, which Prometheus can scrape.

---

### 4. **Scraping Custom Application Metrics**

**Explanation:**
Prometheus can scrape metrics not only from Kubernetes but also from custom applications. Developers need to expose a metrics endpoint using Prometheus libraries in their applications. 

- **Scenario:** Your team has a custom application, and you want to monitor additional metrics like health checks, liveliness probes, etc. Developers need to expose these metrics, and you configure Prometheus to scrape them via its config map.
- **Command:** Update the Prometheus `ConfigMap` to scrape new metrics by adding an entry for the custom application's metrics endpoint.

---

### 5. **Installing Grafana to Visualize Prometheus Metrics**

**Step-by-Step Commands:**
1. **Add the Grafana Helm Repository:**
 ```bash
   helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo update
 ```
   **Explanation:** This adds the Grafana Helm chart repository and updates the Helm repo list to ensure you have the latest versions.
   - **Output:** 
 ```bash
     "grafana" has been added to your repositories
 ```

2. **Install Grafana:**
 ```bash
   helm install grafana grafana/grafana
 ```
   **Explanation:** This installs Grafana using Helm, which will help visualize the metrics scraped by Prometheus.
   - **Scenario:** You want to create visual dashboards of the metrics gathered by Prometheus.
   - **Output:**
 ```bash
     NAME: grafana
     LAST DEPLOYED: <timestamp>
     NAMESPACE: default
     STATUS: deployed
 ```

3. **Retrieve Grafana Admin Password:**
 ```bash
   kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
 ```
   **Explanation:** Grafana generates a random admin password when installed. This command retrieves and decodes that password.
   - **Scenario:** You need to log in to Grafana for the first time.
   - **Output:** (The decoded password will be displayed.)

4. **Expose Grafana via NodePort:**
 ```bash
   kubectl expose service grafana --type=NodePort --name=grafana-ext
 ```
   **Explanation:** Similar to Prometheus, this command exposes the Grafana service so it can be accessed externally.
   - **Scenario:** You want to visualize Prometheus metrics from outside the cluster.
   - **Output:**
 ```bash
     service/grafana-ext exposed
 ```

5. **Access Grafana Dashboard:**
   After retrieving the Minikube IP using `minikube ip`, open a browser and navigate to:
 ```
   http://<minikube-ip>:31281
 ```
   Enter the admin credentials (user: `admin`, password: retrieved above).

### 6. **Monitoring Kubernetes Metrics using Grafana Dashboards**

**Explanation:**  
Once logged into Grafana, you can create dashboards by connecting Grafana to Prometheus. This allows you to visualize Kubernetes metrics, such as pod health, resource usage, and custom metrics from applications.

- **Scenario:** You want to visualize the default metrics provided by Kubernetes API and additional metrics scraped via Cube State Metrics or custom application metrics.
- **Next Steps:** Explore Grafana's features and create dashboards to monitor and visualize Kubernetes cluster health.

---

### Summary:

- **Prometheus:** Monitors Kubernetes cluster metrics, but limited to default metrics unless configured to scrape custom metrics.
- **Grafana:** Provides an interface for visualizing metrics collected by Prometheus.
- **NodePort:** Used to expose services (like Prometheus and Grafana) for external access.
- **Custom Metrics:** Developers can expose application-specific metrics using Prometheus libraries, allowing for more detailed monitoring.

Let's break down the content step by step, explaining each concept in detail along with the commands, outputs, and relevant scenarios.

### 1. **Converting ClusterIP Service to NodePort Service:**

#### Command:
```bash
kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --name=prometheus-server-ext
```

**Explanation:**
- **ClusterIP Service**: By default, Kubernetes services use `ClusterIP`, making the service accessible only within the cluster.
- **NodePort Service**: Exposes the service outside the cluster on a specific port. This makes it possible to access Prometheus from outside the cluster.
- The `kubectl expose` command changes the service type to `NodePort` and creates a new service named `prometheus-server-ext` to expose it externally.

#### Output:
```bash
service/prometheus-server-ext exposed
```

#### Verification:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```

**Output:**
```bash
NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
prometheus-server-ext   NodePort    10.107.147.66   <none>        9090:31110/TCP    5m
```

**Scenario:**
This is used when you want to expose internal services like Prometheus externally for monitoring purposes. The service will now be accessible via the Node IP and the NodePort.

### 2. **Accessing Prometheus UI:**

#### Command:
```bash
minikube ip
```

- This gives the IP address of the Kubernetes node.

```bash
http://<minikube-ip>:31110
```

**Explanation:**
- Access the Prometheus UI by using the Minikube IP along with the NodePort (`31110`).
- Once you open the UI, you can start querying metrics exposed by Prometheus.

#### Scenario:
This allows you to monitor and query metrics from Prometheus, including Kubernetes cluster health, node performance, and application metrics.

### 3. **Prometheus Queries:**

- **Prometheus Query Language (PromQL)**: This is used to query and visualize metrics.
- Example Queries:
  - To get CPU usage:
```prometheus
    rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])
```
  - To get memory usage:
```prometheus
    node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes
```

**Scenario:**
Prometheus queries are used to gain insights into the state of Kubernetes nodes, Pods, and other resources. Developers can use custom queries to monitor application-specific metrics by exposing custom endpoints.

### 4. **Adding Custom Metrics:**

**Explanation:**
- Kubernetes API server and `kube-state-metrics` provide basic metrics.
- If you want more detailed application-specific metrics, developers can expose custom metrics endpoints using Prometheus libraries.

**Scenario:**
For applications running in the cluster, custom metrics can be exposed, allowing Prometheus to scrape and monitor specific aspects like request latency, error rates, or health checks.

### 5. **Installing Grafana Using Helm:**

#### Command:
```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install grafana grafana/grafana
```

**Explanation:**
- **Helm Repo Add**: Adds the Grafana Helm chart repository.
- **Helm Install**: Installs Grafana on the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Scenario:
Grafana is used to visualize Prometheus metrics on customizable dashboards. It provides more flexible and visually appealing ways to monitor Kubernetes clusters.

### 6. **Retrieving Grafana Admin Password:**

#### Command:
```bash
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
```

**Explanation:**
- Grafana's login credentials are stored as a Kubernetes secret. The command retrieves and decodes the admin password.

#### Scenario:
Once installed, Grafana requires this password for login, which allows access to the Grafana UI to create dashboards based on Prometheus metrics.

### 7. **Exposing Grafana as a NodePort Service:**

#### Command:
```bash
kubectl expose service grafana --type=NodePort --name=grafana-ext
```

- This exposes the Grafana service externally, allowing you to access it outside the cluster.

#### Command to Verify:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```

**Output:**
```bash
NAME           TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
grafana-ext    NodePort   10.100.48.74   <none>        80:31281/TCP     3m
```

### 8. **Accessing Grafana UI:**

#### Command:
```bash
minikube ip
```

- This gives the IP address of your Minikube node.

```bash
http://<minikube-ip>:31281
```

**Scenario:**
After exposing Grafana, you can now access the Grafana UI using the NodePort. This allows for dashboard creation using Prometheus metrics.

### 9. **Kube-State-Metrics:**

**Explanation:**
- **Kube-State-Metrics** collects cluster-level information like the status of Deployments, Pods, Services, and more.
- It provides additional metrics not available from the Kubernetes API server, such as replica count or resource limits for Pods.

#### Scenario:
This is particularly useful in production environments where you need detailed insights into the state of Kubernetes resources beyond what the API server provides.

### 10. **Conclusion:**
You have successfully installed and exposed Prometheus and Grafana. You can now create custom dashboards in Grafana to visualize various metrics from your Kubernetes cluster. Custom applications can also expose their own metrics, which Prometheus can scrape and Grafana can display. This setup allows for comprehensive monitoring of both cluster resources and applications.

--- 

Each of these steps introduces you to Kubernetes monitoring and observability using Prometheus and Grafana, and custom metrics help to provide detailed insights into both the cluster and application health.
