Let's break down and explain each concept and command in detail from the provided text. We'll discuss the purpose of each step, command usage, and explain the scenarios for use.

---

### 1. **Exposing the Prometheus Server on a NodePort**
   - **Concept**: 
     - By default, the Prometheus service runs as a **ClusterIP** service, which restricts access to within the Kubernetes cluster. To access it from outside the cluster (e.g., through a browser), you can convert the service to a **NodePort** service.
     - **NodePort** exposes the service on a specific port on each node, allowing external access.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --name=prometheus-server-ext -n monitoring
 ```
     - **Explanation**: This command exposes the existing `prometheus-server` service using the NodePort method and names the new service `prometheus-server-ext`.
     - **Scenario**: You use this command to make Prometheus available externally, allowing access to its UI and API from outside the cluster.

   - **Output (Checking Services)**:
 ```bash
     kubectl get svc -n monitoring
 ```
     - **Explanation**: This command lists all services in the `monitoring` namespace, including the newly exposed `prometheus-server-ext` service.
     - **Scenario**: You use this command to verify that the new NodePort service is created and is ready to be accessed externally.

---

### 2. **Accessing Prometheus UI**
   - **Concept**: 
     - To access the Prometheus UI after exposing it via NodePort, you need the IP address of the Kubernetes node and the assigned port.
   - **Command (Getting Minikube IP)**:
 ```bash
     minikube ip
 ```
     - **Explanation**: This command retrieves the IP address of the Minikube cluster. This IP address is used along with the NodePort to access the Prometheus server.
   
   - **Accessing the Prometheus UI**:
     - In a browser, enter the URL with the IP and NodePort:
 ```bash
       http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>
 ```
       For example:
 ```bash
       http://192.168.99.100:31110
 ```
     - **Scenario**: This URL allows you to access the Prometheus UI from a browser where you can start running Prometheus queries.

---

### 3. **Prometheus Queries**
   - **Concept**:
     - **Prometheus Queries (PromQL)** are used to retrieve specific metrics data from Prometheus. By default, Prometheus provides Kubernetes API metrics, but for custom applications, developers can expose custom metrics.
   - **Explanation**: You can either refer to the Prometheus documentation or tools like ChatGPT for guidance on Prometheus queries. You can run Prometheus queries directly on the UI to fetch metrics about your Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Scenario**: If you need to monitor custom applications in your cluster, your developers must expose application-specific metrics using Prometheus libraries.

---

### 4. **Custom Metrics from Applications**
   - **Concept**: 
     - Prometheus allows scraping metrics from applications. Developers must expose a metrics endpoint from their application using Prometheus libraries, and Prometheus can scrape those metrics for monitoring purposes.
   - **Configuring Prometheus to Scrape Custom Metrics**:
     - To collect custom metrics, you need to configure Prometheus by editing its **ConfigMap** and adding the scrape target for your custom application.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     kubectl edit configmap prometheus-server -n monitoring
 ```
     - **Explanation**: This opens the `ConfigMap` for the Prometheus server where you can add new scrape configurations. For instance, you can add your application’s metrics endpoint here.
     - **Scenario**: You use this to configure Prometheus to scrape custom metrics from your applications in addition to the default Kubernetes metrics.

---

### 5. **Installing Grafana Using Helm**
   - **Concept**: 
     - **Grafana** is a visualization tool often used with Prometheus to create dashboards that present metrics in a more readable format.
     - You can install Grafana using Helm, which simplifies the process by managing all necessary resources automatically.
   - **Command (Adding Grafana Helm Chart)**:
 ```bash
     helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
     helm repo update
 ```
     - **Explanation**: Adds the Grafana Helm repository and updates it to ensure you are using the latest version of the charts.
   
   - **Command (Installing Grafana)**:
 ```bash
     helm install grafana grafana/grafana --namespace monitoring
 ```
     - **Explanation**: Installs Grafana into the `monitoring` namespace of the Kubernetes cluster.
     - **Scenario**: You use Helm to easily install and manage Grafana for visualizing Prometheus metrics on your Kubernetes cluster.

---

### 6. **Retrieving Grafana Admin Password**
   - **Concept**: 
     - Grafana’s admin password is stored in a Kubernetes secret after installation, and you need to retrieve it to log into the Grafana UI.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     kubectl get secret --namespace monitoring grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
 ```
     - **Explanation**: This command retrieves and decodes the admin password from the Grafana secret in the `monitoring` namespace.
     - **Scenario**: You use this to log into the Grafana UI for the first time after installation.

---

### 7. **Exposing Grafana as a NodePort Service**
   - **Concept**:
     - By default, Grafana is installed as a **ClusterIP** service, meaning it’s only accessible within the cluster. To access it externally, you need to expose it as a **NodePort** service.
   - **Command (Exposing Grafana)**:
 ```bash
     kubectl expose service grafana --type=NodePort --name=grafana-ext -n monitoring
 ```
     - **Explanation**: This exposes the Grafana service via NodePort, naming it `grafana-ext`, and allows external access.
   - **Command (Checking Services)**:
 ```bash
     kubectl get svc -n monitoring
 ```
     - **Explanation**: This command lists the services in the `monitoring` namespace, where you should now see `grafana-ext` exposed with a NodePort.
     - **Scenario**: This is necessary if you want to access the Grafana dashboard externally.

---

### 8. **Accessing Grafana UI**
   - **Concept**:
     - Similar to Prometheus, you can access the Grafana UI using the Minikube IP and the NodePort assigned to the `grafana-ext` service.
   - **Command (Getting Minikube IP)**:
 ```bash
     minikube ip
 ```
     - **Explanation**: Retrieves the Minikube IP address.
   
   - **Accessing the Grafana UI**:
     - Use the Minikube IP and NodePort to access Grafana:
 ```bash
       http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>
 ```
       For example:
 ```bash
       http://192.168.99.100:31281
 ```
     - **Scenario**: After exposing Grafana, you access the dashboard to visualize Prometheus data. You log in using the admin password retrieved earlier.

---

### 9. **Conclusion: Setting up Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes**
   - **Prometheus**: Installed and configured to monitor Kubernetes cluster metrics.
   - **Grafana**: Installed and exposed for visualizing Prometheus data on dashboards.
   - **Custom Metrics**: You can extend Prometheus by configuring it to scrape metrics from custom applications deployed in the cluster.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - **Prometheus**: Monitor the health and performance of Kubernetes clusters and applications.
     - **Grafana**: Visualize metrics on customizable dashboards for easier interpretation of data.

Each command and concept is crucial in successfully setting up Prometheus and Grafana on a Kubernetes cluster for monitoring and visualization purposes.

Let's break down and explain each concept from the text, with detailed explanations to clarify how each step works, the purpose of commands, and how everything fits into the Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana monitoring ecosystem.

---

### 1. **Exposing Prometheus Server**

#### Command:
```bash
kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --name=prometheus-server-ext
```

#### Explanation:
This command converts the Prometheus service from **ClusterIP** (accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster) to **NodePort** (accessible from outside the cluster through a specific port on each node). By using `kubectl expose`, you’re creating a new service (`prometheus-server-ext`) that allows external access to the Prometheus server.

#### Purpose:
- **NodePort Service**: Makes the Prometheus server UI accessible externally on a specific port (e.g., `31110`). 
- **Scenario**: You need to access Prometheus from outside the cluster, for example, to view metrics on your browser by using the Kubernetes node IP and the assigned NodePort.

#### Example Output:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```
You will see:
```bash
NAME                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
prometheus-server-ext    NodePort    10.96.0.24   <none>        9090:31110/TCP    5m
```

---

### 2. **Getting Kubernetes Node IP**

#### Command:
```bash
minikube ip
```

#### Explanation:
This command retrieves the external IP address of the Minikube node, which is necessary to access the Prometheus server. The IP will be used along with the NodePort (`31110` in this case) to access the Prometheus dashboard in a browser.

#### Purpose:
- **Scenario**: To expose and access the Prometheus server, you need the node's IP and port. This command fetches the IP address where the NodePort service is running.

---

### 3. **Prometheus Queries and Metrics**

#### Explanation:
Once Prometheus is installed, you can start using **Prometheus Queries** (known as **PromQL** or Prometheus Query Language). These queries allow you to fetch and analyze metrics from the Prometheus database. If you're unfamiliar with Prometheus queries, the official documentation or tools like ChatGPT can assist.

#### Key Concepts:
- **PromQL**: Query language for Prometheus to retrieve metrics.
- **API Server Metrics**: By default, Prometheus can access metrics exposed by the Kubernetes API server, such as pod status, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
- **Custom Application Metrics**: If developers deploy applications in the cluster and want to track their performance, they need to expose custom metrics (e.g., health checks or probe statuses) using Prometheus libraries.

#### Scenario:
You want to track custom metrics of an application deployed in your cluster. To do this, the developer must expose metrics via a Prometheus-compatible endpoint, and Prometheus can then scrape this data for monitoring.

---

### 4. **Configuring Prometheus to Scrape Custom Metrics**

#### Explanation:
In Prometheus, you define **scrape targets** in a **config map**. A scrape target is a location (URL) from which Prometheus retrieves metrics. For example, if you want to gather metrics from a custom application, you'd add the endpoint to the Prometheus config map.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Config Map**: A configuration file in Kubernetes where you can specify Prometheus scrape jobs.
- **Scraping Custom Metrics**: Prometheus can gather custom metrics by scraping from endpoints exposed by applications (e.g., `http://your-app:8080/metrics`).

---

### 5. **Installing Grafana using Helm**

#### Commands:
```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install grafana grafana/grafana
```

#### Explanation:
This installs Grafana, a popular tool for visualizing metrics data. Grafana can be installed using Helm, just like Prometheus. After adding the Grafana repository and updating it, you can use `helm install` to deploy Grafana in your Kubernetes cluster.

#### Purpose:
- **Visualization**: Grafana provides dashboards to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus.
- **Scenario**: After setting up Prometheus, use Grafana to create visual representations of your data, such as CPU usage, pod health, or custom application metrics.

---

### 6. **Getting Grafana Admin Password**

#### Command:
```bash
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
```

#### Explanation:
This command retrieves the admin password generated by Kubernetes for Grafana. Grafana’s default user is `admin`, and this command extracts the password from the Kubernetes secret stored in your cluster.

#### Key Concept:
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Sensitive information like passwords are stored in Kubernetes secrets. You can fetch these values when required, as shown in the command above.

#### Scenario:
Before logging into Grafana’s dashboard, you need the admin password. Use the command to fetch it from the secret created during Grafana installation.

---

### 7. **Exposing Grafana Service**

#### Command:
```bash
kubectl expose service grafana --type=NodePort --name=grafana-ext
```

#### Explanation:
Like Prometheus, Grafana's default service is of type **ClusterIP**, which means it's only accessible within the cluster. This command converts it into a **NodePort** service, allowing you to access Grafana’s web interface from outside the cluster using a NodePort (e.g., `31281`).

#### Purpose:
- **Scenario**: To access Grafana's dashboard in your browser, the service needs to be exposed as a NodePort. This way, you can log in using the node IP and port (`31281`).

#### Example Output:
```bash
kubectl get svc
```
You will see:
```bash
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
grafana-ext     NodePort    10.96.0.50     <none>        3000:31281/TCP    5m
```

---

### 8. **Grafana Login and Dashboard Setup**

#### Explanation:
Once Grafana is exposed and accessible via NodePort, you can log in using the admin credentials. Grafana integrates with Prometheus as a **data source** and provides an interface to create dashboards, graphs, and alerts based on the metrics stored in Prometheus.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Data Sources**: Grafana uses data sources like Prometheus to fetch metrics.
- **Dashboard**: A visual representation of metrics, where you can create and customize graphs, tables, and alerts.
- **Scenario**: After logging in, you configure Prometheus as a data source and create dashboards to monitor Kubernetes cluster performance, custom application metrics, or other data.

---

### 9. **Prometheus vs kube-state-metrics**

#### Explanation:
- **Prometheus**: By default, Prometheus gathers metrics from the Kubernetes API server, which provides basic information about the cluster.
- **kube-state-metrics**: This provides additional metrics about the state of Kubernetes objects (e.g., pods, deployments). It exposes metrics that are not available through the API server, such as the status of deployments, number of replicas, and the health of pods.

#### Key Concept:
- **Why kube-state-metrics?**: It adds value by giving deeper insights into the actual state of Kubernetes resources beyond what the API server can provide.

#### Scenario:
You want to monitor whether all replicas of a deployment are running correctly, or track the health of all services in the cluster. kube-state-metrics provides this information, which Prometheus can then scrape and store.

---

### 10. **Ingress and Ingress Controllers**

#### Explanation:
In production environments, instead of exposing services using NodePort, you use **Ingress** resources and an **Ingress Controller** to manage access to services. Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that controls external access to services, usually via HTTP or HTTPS. The Ingress Controller handles routing and load balancing based on these rules.

#### Scenario:
In a production environment, you would set up Ingress to handle external access to Prometheus, Grafana, or other services. This avoids the need to expose each service manually using NodePort.

---

### Conclusion

1. **Exposing Services**: Using NodePort is essential in development or testing environments to access services like Prometheus and Grafana from outside the cluster.
2. **Prometheus & Custom Metrics**: Prometheus collects data from Kubernetes API by default but can be extended to monitor custom applications via scrape endpoints.
3. **Grafana**: Once integrated with Prometheus, it allows for the visualization of metrics through customizable dashboards, helping with monitoring and troubleshooting.
4. **kube-state-metrics**: Extends the metrics collection capabilities of Prometheus by exposing deeper insights into Kubernetes resources.

This workflow demonstrates the process of setting up and accessing Prometheus and Grafana, adding custom metrics, and exposing services in a Kubernetes environment.
