### **1. Why Kubernetes Monitoring is Important**

Kubernetes monitoring is essential for observing the health, performance, and reliability of your clusters and applications. As organizations scale, they often manage multiple Kubernetes clusters for different environments like development, staging, and production. Effective monitoring allows you to:

- Identify performance bottlenecks.
- Debug issues in real-time (e.g., Pods failing or services not reachable).
- Track resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk usage).
- Ensure application uptime by monitoring API servers, services, deployments, and more.

#### **Scenario: Managing Multiple Kubernetes Clusters**

In a typical scenario:
- Multiple teams might be using a single Kubernetes cluster.
- Each team needs to ensure their services and deployments are running smoothly.
- A DevOps engineer needs to monitor the entire infrastructure for performance issues or failures.

As the number of clusters grows, the complexity increases. Monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** help streamline this process.

### **2. What is Prometheus?**

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit developed initially by SoundCloud. It is widely used in Kubernetes environments because it seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes to collect metrics.

#### **Prometheus Features**:
- **Time-Series Database**: Prometheus stores all data in a time-series format, making it easy to query historical data.
- **Service Discovery**: It can automatically discover Kubernetes services and collect metrics.
- **PromQL**: Prometheus uses a powerful query language called PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) to retrieve and aggregate metrics.
- **Alerting**: Prometheus can trigger alerts based on conditions, e.g., if a service is down or if resource usage crosses a threshold.

---

### **3. What is Grafana?**

Grafana is a popular open-source visualization tool that can be used alongside Prometheus to visualize the collected data. While Prometheus provides the raw metrics, Grafana presents them in an intuitive and customizable dashboard format.

#### **Grafana Features**:
- **Visualizations**: It supports graphs, heatmaps, gauges, and tables.
- **Custom Dashboards**: You can create custom dashboards based on the data sources you configure.
- **Data Sources**: Grafana can use Prometheus as a data source along with other options like Elasticsearch, MySQL, and InfluxDB.

### **4. Installing Prometheus and Grafana in Kubernetes**

#### **Prerequisite**:
You need a Kubernetes cluster (either local using **Minikube** or in production) to set up Prometheus and Grafana.

#### **Steps to Install Prometheus**:

1. **Add Prometheus Helm Repository**:
   Helm is the easiest way to install Prometheus in Kubernetes.

 ```bash
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo update
 ```

2. **Install Prometheus Using Helm**:
   You can use Helm to install Prometheus with default settings.

 ```bash
   helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
 ```

   This will deploy Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster, including components like Prometheus server, alert manager, and node exporters.

3. **Access Prometheus**:
   You can access the Prometheus dashboard using `kubectl port-forward`.

 ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:80
 ```

   Visit `http://localhost:9090` to access the Prometheus dashboard.

#### **Steps to Install Grafana**:

1. **Add Grafana Helm Repository**:
   Similar to Prometheus, you can use Helm to install Grafana.

 ```bash
   helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo update
 ```

2. **Install Grafana**:

 ```bash
   helm install grafana grafana/grafana
 ```

3. **Access Grafana**:
   Forward the Grafana service to your local machine:

 ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80
 ```

   You can now access the Grafana dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`. The default login credentials are `admin/admin`.

4. **Add Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana**:
   - In the Grafana UI, navigate to **Configuration > Data Sources**.
   - Select **Prometheus** as the data source.
   - Enter the Prometheus server URL (e.g., `http://prometheus-server:80`) and save.

### **5. Prometheus Architecture**

Understanding Prometheus' architecture is crucial for explaining how it monitors Kubernetes clusters:

#### **Components**:
- **Prometheus Server**: The core of Prometheus, which collects metrics from targets and stores them in a time-series database.
- **HTTP Server**: Prometheus exposes an HTTP server to handle requests and queries using PromQL.
- **Targets**: These are endpoints (e.g., Kubernetes nodes, Pods, or services) from which Prometheus scrapes metrics. The default Kubernetes API exposes many useful metrics like resource usage.
- **Alertmanager**: Prometheus can be configured to send alerts based on metrics using this component.
- **Time-Series Database**: Prometheus stores all metrics in a time-series format, which helps in querying and aggregating data over time.

#### **How Prometheus Collects Data**:
- **Scraping**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from services at specified intervals. For example, it scrapes the Kubernetes API server at `http://<api-server>/metrics`.
- **Storage**: Prometheus stores this data in a time-series database, which can be queried later.
- **Alerting**: Based on certain thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 90%), Prometheus can send alerts.

---

### **6. Visualizing Kubernetes Metrics with Grafana**

Once Prometheus is collecting metrics, Grafana is used for visualizing them.

#### **Creating Dashboards in Grafana**:

1. **Create a New Dashboard**:
   - Go to **Dashboards > New Dashboard** in the Grafana UI.
   - Add new panels and use Prometheus queries (PromQL) to display metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and replica counts.

2. **Example Prometheus Queries**:
   - **CPU Usage**:
 ```promql
     sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) by (namespace, pod)
 ```

   - **Memory Usage**:
 ```promql
     sum(container_memory_usage_bytes) by (namespace, pod)
 ```

   - **Pod Status**:
 ```promql
     count(kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true"}) by (namespace)
 ```

3. **Customize Panels**:
   - Grafana allows you to customize each panel (graph, heatmap, gauge, etc.) to suit your needs. You can monitor deployments, services, resource usage, and overall cluster health.
  
4. **Monitoring API Servers and Deployments**:
   - You can monitor the API server's performance and deployment status (replicas, health checks) using Prometheus metrics exposed by Kubernetes components.

Grafana takes the metrics collected by Prometheus and presents them in a dashboard, offering better visualization for understanding performance, issues, and resource utilization.

#### **Scenario**:
You use Grafana to create a dashboard showing CPU and memory usage for all your Kubernetes clusters. It helps visualize spikes in resource usage that could lead to degraded performance.

---

### **4. Prometheus Architecture Overview**

#### **Concept**:
The Prometheus architecture involves several components that collect and store metrics data:
- **Prometheus Server**: Fetches metrics from different targets (like Kubernetes API server and applications).
- **Targets**: Include Kubernetes components like API servers, Kubelets, etc.
- **Time-Series Database**: Stores the collected metrics for querying.

#### **Command to Access API Server Metrics**:
```bash
kubectl get --raw "/metrics"
```
This command retrieves the metrics directly from the Kubernetes API server, which Prometheus can later query.

#### **Purpose**:
The architecture explains how Prometheus fetches data from different sources and stores it in a time-series database, making it available for querying and alerting.

#### **Scenario**:
Your Kubernetes API server exposes metrics related to the health of the system. Prometheus queries these metrics at regular intervals, allowing you to monitor the status of deployments and services.

   - Create visual panels showing metrics such as API server health, Pod statuses, and resource usage.

3. **Visualize Metrics**:
   Use PromQL queries in Grafana to show the status of your deployments. Example:
 ```promql
   sum(kube_pod_container_resource_limits_cpu_cores) by (namespace)
 ```

4. **Alerts**:
   Configure alerts in Prometheus to notify you when a specific threshold is crossed, such as high CPU usage or Pods being in a crash loop.

#### **Purpose**:
This setup allows you to actively monitor the health of your Kubernetes clusters, detect issues early, and maintain system reliability.

#### **Scenario**:
By monitoring CPU and memory usage for deployments, you can configure alerts to notify the team when resource consumption crosses a critical threshold, preventing outages.

---

### **6. Writing Custom Prometheus Queries**

#### **Concept**:
PromQL is a powerful query language used in Prometheus to extract metrics data. You can write custom queries to fetch the metrics you need for dashboards and alerts.

#### **Example Query**:
```promql
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```
This query calculates the rate of HTTP requests over the past 5 minutes.

#### **Purpose**:
Custom queries allow you to tailor the monitoring setup to your needs, whether it's for performance tracking, error detection, or resource consumption.

#### **Scenario**:
You use PromQL to monitor HTTP request rates for an application deployed in Kubernetes, allowing you to detect traffic spikes or performance bottlenecks.
