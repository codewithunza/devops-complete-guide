### 1. **Understanding Metrics in Prometheus and Exposing Them to Grafana**

#### Concept:
- Prometheus stores metrics in a specific format that is not particularly human-friendly when viewed directly. The format is structured to be efficient for machines to process, typically in a key-value pair style known as the "metrics format" rather than JSON.
- Prometheus queries allow users to pull specific metrics from this pool, and tools like Grafana can use the same data to provide more user-friendly, visual representations of these metrics.

#### Steps:
- **Access Prometheus Metrics Directly:**
  You can access the metrics directly by going to the `/metrics` endpoint, which provides raw data.
  - Example: `http://<minikube-ip>:30421/metrics`
  - Here, you'll see metrics in plain text format, with key-value pairs representing different aspects of the cluster (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage).

- **Prometheus Query Example:**
```prometheus
  up{job="kubernetes-apiservers"}
```
  This query checks the status of the Kubernetes API server.

#### Output:
- **Prometheus Output (Raw):**
 ```plaintext
   up{instance="192.168.64.15:6443", job="kubernetes-apiservers"} 1
 ```
   This indicates that the Kubernetes API server is "up" (value 1).

- **Grafana Output (Visual):**
   Grafana uses the same query but presents the data visually, e.g., a gauge showing whether the API server is up or down, making the information much easier to consume.

#### Scenario:
The purpose of accessing metrics directly from Prometheus is typically for debugging or fine-tuning. In practice, Grafana is used for monitoring because it visualizes the same metrics in a much clearer format, aiding decision-making.

---

### 2. **Setting Up and Visualizing Kubernetes Metrics with Grafana**

#### Concept:
Grafana offers pre-built dashboards (like ID 3662) that are designed to pull common Kubernetes metrics (e.g., node uptime, API server status, etc.) and present them visually. If more information is required, additional metrics can be exposed.

#### Steps:
- **Default Dashboard (ID: 3662):**
   This dashboard provides predefined panels that show:
   - Node uptime.
   - Status of key Kubernetes components (API server, etcd, etc.).
   
- **Adding More Metrics:**
   If you want to extend the metrics available in Grafana (for example, metrics related to deployments or custom applications), you can expose additional data endpoints like `kube-state-metrics` or ask your developers to expose application metrics at `/metrics`.

#### Scenario:
This step is crucial when the organization’s monitoring requirements extend beyond the default set of Kubernetes metrics. For example, an organization may want to monitor custom applications that developers have written, requiring DevOps engineers to configure Prometheus to scrape these new endpoints.

---

### 3. **Configuring Prometheus to Scrape New Metrics**

#### Concept:
Prometheus scrapes metrics from multiple sources based on the configuration in its `prometheus.yaml` file, which includes the list of endpoints to pull data from. By editing the configuration, you can add new scrape targets, such as custom application endpoints.

#### Steps:
- **Edit the Prometheus Config Map:**
 ```bash
   kubectl edit cm prometheus-server
 ```

- **Add New Scrape Job:**
   In the `prometheus.yaml`, add a new job to scrape the `kube-state-metrics` endpoint:
 ```yaml
   - job_name: 'kube-state-metrics'
     static_configs:
       - targets: ['192.168.64.15:30421']
 ```

#### Output:
- After updating the config map, Prometheus will start scraping the new endpoint. You can verify this by checking the `/targets` endpoint of Prometheus to ensure the new job is being scraped.
 ```bash
   http://<prometheus-server-ip>:9090/targets
 ```

#### Scenario:
This configuration is useful for DevOps engineers who need to extend Prometheus’ capabilities to monitor more services or applications. For example, if your organization develops a new microservice, you will need to add that service’s `/metrics` endpoint to Prometheus to begin collecting data.

---

### 4. **Monitoring Application Metrics**

#### Concept:
Beyond Kubernetes-native metrics, custom applications can expose their own metrics, such as HTTP request counts or response times, at the `/metrics` endpoint using libraries like Prometheus client libraries.

#### Steps:
1. **Ask Developers to Implement a Metrics Endpoint:**
   - Developers should add Prometheus client libraries (available for various programming languages like Go, Python, Java, etc.) to their applications.
   - The application should expose a `/metrics` endpoint that Prometheus can scrape.

2. **Example of an Application Metrics Endpoint:**
   - A simple Python application could expose metrics like:
 ```plaintext
     http_requests_total{method="post", code="200"} 10
 ```
   - This shows that the application received 10 HTTP POST requests with a `200 OK` response.

3. **Add Application Metrics to Prometheus:**
   - Add the new application’s `/metrics` endpoint to the Prometheus config map, similar to how you added `kube-state-metrics` earlier.

#### Scenario:
This is critical for organizations that need insights into custom applications beyond just infrastructure-level metrics (e.g., CPU usage). For example, a web application might expose metrics about the number of active sessions, API response times, or error rates, which are important for performance monitoring.

---

### 5. **Visualizing Application Metrics in Grafana**

#### Concept:
Once Prometheus starts scraping application-specific metrics, they can be visualized in Grafana. These metrics can be used to create custom dashboards tailored to monitoring application health and performance.

#### Steps:
1. **Create a Custom Dashboard in Grafana:**
   - Go to Grafana, click on "Create Dashboard," and add new panels.
   - Use Prometheus queries to pull the metrics from the custom application.
   
2. **Example Query for Custom Application:**
 ```prometheus
   http_requests_total{job="my-application"}
 ```
   This query will display the total number of HTTP requests handled by the custom application.

#### Scenario:
Custom dashboards are especially useful when monitoring specific services or applications critical to your business. For instance, you could create a dashboard showing key performance metrics (response times, request counts, error rates) for a public-facing API.

### 6. **Conclusion:**

In this process, we set up monitoring and visualization for both Kubernetes and custom applications using Prometheus and Grafana. Key takeaways include:
- Prometheus collects raw data, and Grafana visualizes it.
- Adding new scrape targets in Prometheus is straightforward through the config map.
- Custom metrics can be exposed by applications, and this data can be visualized just like infrastructure metrics.
- Grafana’s ease of use allows for real-time monitoring, which can be crucial for ensuring system reliability.

By understanding how to extend Prometheus with new metrics and visualize them in Grafana, DevOps engineers can provide comprehensive monitoring for both infrastructure and applications.

Let's break down the key concepts, commands, and processes outlined in your text for setting up and using Prometheus and Grafana for Kubernetes monitoring. I will explain each concept in detail, including how to implement the commands and their outputs, and why each step is useful.

---

### 1. **Matrix Data in Kubernetes and Prometheus**
   
**Explanation:**
When you query Kubernetes for metrics (e.g., via Cube State Metrics), the data is returned in a matrix format, which provides raw metric values about your Kubernetes cluster. For example, it can return information about node status, pod status, API server health, and more. This data is typically presented in a Prometheus-compatible format, which is human-readable but better suited for machines.

- **Scenario:**
  The matrix data can be used to monitor various components of the cluster. For example, a DevOps engineer may want to check the status of all deployments, services, or node health. The matrix format is raw, but it can be visualized using tools like Grafana.

- **Command Example:**
  To query Prometheus for Kubernetes metrics, you can use the following PromQL query for deployment status:
```promql
  sum(kube_deployment_status_replicas) by (deployment)
```
  **Expected Output:**
  Prometheus will return the status of all deployments. This output is in a raw matrix format, showing the number of replicas for each deployment.

---

### 2. **Prometheus Queries and Grafana Visualization**

**Explanation:**
Prometheus queries (written in PromQL) are used to pull specific data from the Kubernetes cluster. Grafana uses Prometheus as its data source and can run the same queries but presents the results in a graphical or visual format. This is especially helpful because visualizations such as graphs, bar charts, and tables make it easier to interpret data.

- **Scenario:**
  If you're monitoring the status of nodes, pods, or deployments, visualizations make it easier to detect anomalies or performance issues over time compared to raw data.

- **Example Command:**
  Running the same query in Prometheus:
```promql
  sum(kube_node_status_condition) by (condition)
```
  In Prometheus, this will return a raw JSON output. When run in Grafana, it will generate a graph showing the status of nodes.

---

### 3. **Prometheus ConfigMap - Scrape Configuration**

**Explanation:**
Prometheus uses a **ConfigMap** in Kubernetes to configure which endpoints to scrape for metrics. By default, Prometheus may scrape from its local server or other default services (e.g., Kubernetes API server). To get additional metrics, such as Cube State Metrics, you need to edit the Prometheus ConfigMap and add the necessary endpoint.

- **Scenario:**
  Suppose you want to monitor more detailed metrics from Cube State Metrics (like pod replicas or service health), you need to add this endpoint to the Prometheus scrape configuration.

- **Command Example:**
  1. Edit the Prometheus ConfigMap:
 ```bash
     kubectl edit cm prometheus-server -n monitoring
 ```
  2. Add a new job to scrape Cube State Metrics:
 ```yaml
     scrape_configs:
       - job_name: 'kube-state-metrics'
         static_configs:
           - targets: ['192.168.64.15:30421']
 ```

- **Expected Output:**
  After saving the configuration, Prometheus will start scraping Cube State Metrics, and you’ll see this data in your Prometheus queries and Grafana dashboards.

---

### 4. **Expose Cube State Metrics via NodePort**

**Explanation:**
To make Cube State Metrics accessible to Prometheus, you expose it using a NodePort service in Kubernetes. This service exposes the Cube State Metrics application to the external network, allowing Prometheus to scrape it.

- **Scenario:**
  Exposing Cube State Metrics allows Prometheus to gather detailed metrics about Kubernetes resources such as deployments, replicas, and service status.

- **Command Example:**
  To expose Cube State Metrics on a NodePort:
```bash
  kubectl expose service kube-state-metrics --type=NodePort --name=kube-state-metrics-ext --target-port=8080
```

- **Expected Output:**
  This command creates a new service exposing Cube State Metrics at a NodePort. You can verify this by running:
```bash
  kubectl get svc
```
  Output:
```bash
  kube-state-metrics-ext NodePort 10.96.0.4 <none> 8080:30421/TCP
```

---

### 5. **Access Cube State Metrics Endpoint**

**Explanation:**
Once the Cube State Metrics service is exposed via NodePort, you can access its metrics using the Minikube IP and the assigned port (in this case, 30421).

- **Scenario:**
  You may want to verify the Cube State Metrics endpoint is working before adding it to Prometheus or use it in other monitoring tools.

- **Command Example:**
  Get the Minikube IP:
```bash
  minikube ip
```
  Then access Cube State Metrics:
```bash
  http://<minikube-ip>:30421/metrics
```

- **Expected Output:**
  You will see raw metrics data in a Prometheus-compatible format (e.g., `kube_pod_status_phase`, `kube_deployment_status_replicas`). This confirms that Cube State Metrics is running and can be scraped.

---

### 6. **Prometheus ConfigMap - Application Metrics**

**Explanation:**
Apart from monitoring Kubernetes system components, Prometheus can be used to monitor application-level metrics. Developers can expose metrics from their applications (such as request counts, response times) by using Prometheus client libraries in their code. These metrics can be scraped by Prometheus, similar to Cube State Metrics.

- **Scenario:**
  If you want to monitor a custom application, developers should expose a `/metrics` endpoint that provides the application’s metrics in Prometheus format. You, as a DevOps engineer, can then configure Prometheus to scrape this endpoint.

- **Command Example:**
  1. Developers expose an endpoint like `/metrics` in their application.
  2. Add this new application’s endpoint to the Prometheus ConfigMap:
 ```yaml
     scrape_configs:
       - job_name: 'my-application'
         static_configs:
           - targets: ['192.168.64.16:8080']
 ```

- **Expected Output:**
  Prometheus will start scraping the custom application’s metrics. These metrics can be queried and visualized in Grafana, just like system-level metrics.

---

### 7. **Writing a Prometheus Metrics Server**

**Explanation:**
To expose application-level metrics, developers can write a **Metrics Server** using one of Prometheus's client libraries (available in Go, Python, Java, etc.). This server exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that outputs application-specific metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape.

- **Scenario:**
  If your team is building a web application and you want to monitor the number of requests, latency, or errors, you would ask developers to implement a metrics server.

- **Steps for Developers:**
  - Use Prometheus client libraries to instrument the application.
  - Expose a `/metrics` endpoint that outputs metrics data in Prometheus format.
  
  Example of a Prometheus endpoint in Go:
```go
  import (
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
    "net/http"
  )

  func main() {
    requests := prometheus.NewCounter(prometheus.CounterOpts{
      Name: "http_requests_total",
      Help: "Number of HTTP requests",
    })
    prometheus.MustRegister(requests)

    http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
  }
```

- **Expected Output:**
  The application exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that Prometheus can scrape.

---

### Summary of Commands and Outputs

1. **Query Deployment Status in Prometheus:**
 ```promql
   sum(kube_deployment_status_replicas) by (deployment)
 ```
   - Raw output in Prometheus (JSON format), visualized in Grafana.

2. **Expose Cube State Metrics via NodePort:**
 ```bash
   kubectl expose service kube-state-metrics --type=NodePort --name=kube-state-metrics-ext --target-port=8080
 ```

3. **Edit Prometheus ConfigMap to Scrape Cube State Metrics:**
 ```bash
   kubectl edit cm prometheus-server -n monitoring
 ```
   Add the Cube State Metrics endpoint:
 ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'kube-state-metrics'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['192.168.64.15:30421']
 ```

4. **Access Cube State Metrics:**
 ```bash
   http://<minikube-ip>:30421/metrics
 ```

By following these steps, you can set up detailed monitoring of your Kubernetes cluster and applications using Prometheus and Grafana. This process ensures that you have a comprehensive view of system health, application performance, and resource usage.
