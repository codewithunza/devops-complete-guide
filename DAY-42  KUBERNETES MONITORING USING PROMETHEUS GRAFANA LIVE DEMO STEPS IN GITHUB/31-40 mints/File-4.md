### 7. **Handling Custom Application Metrics**

#### **Concept:**
While `kube-state-metrics` provides metrics about Kubernetes objects, custom applications deployed on the cluster may require their own metrics. Developers need to expose these metrics so that Prometheus can scrape and Grafana can visualize them.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Implement Metrics in Applications:**
   - **Using Prometheus Libraries:**
     - Developers integrate Prometheus client libraries (e.g., `prometheus-client` for Python) into their applications.
     - These libraries allow applications to expose custom metrics via an HTTP endpoint.
   - **Expose Metrics Endpoint:**
     - Applications should expose metrics on an endpoint, typically `/metrics`.
     - **Example in Python:**
       ```python
       from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary

       # Create a metric to track time spent and requests made.
       REQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')

       @REQUEST_TIME.time()
       def process_request():
           # Your code here
           pass

       if __name__ == '__main__':
           start_http_server(8000)
           while True:
               process_request()
       ```
2. **Expose Application Metrics via Kubernetes:**
   - **Service Exposure:**
     - Similar to `kube-state-metrics`, expose the application's metrics endpoint using a `NodePort` or integrate it with existing service discovery mechanisms.
     - **Command:**
       ```bash
       kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=NodePort --name=my-app-metrics-ext --port=8000 --target-port=8000
       ```
3. **Configure Prometheus to Scrape Custom Metrics:**
   - **Edit Prometheus ConfigMap:**
     - Add a new scrape job for the custom application.
     - **Configuration:**
       ```yaml
       scrape_configs:
         - job_name: 'my-app'
           static_configs:
             - targets: ['<MINIKUBE_IP>:<APP_NODE_PORT>']
       ```
     - Replace `<MINIKUBE_IP>` and `<APP_NODE_PORT>` with appropriate values.
4. **Reload Prometheus Configuration:**
   - Prometheus automatically reloads the configuration when the ConfigMap is updated.

#### **Commands:**
```bash
kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=NodePort --name=my-app-metrics-ext --port=8000 --target-port=8000
kubectl edit configmap prometheus-server
```

#### **Purpose:**
- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Ensures that both Kubernetes components and custom applications are monitored.
