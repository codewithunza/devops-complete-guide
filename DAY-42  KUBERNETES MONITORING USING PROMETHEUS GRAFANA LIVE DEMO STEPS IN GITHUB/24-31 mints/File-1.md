### Extracted Concepts: Prometheus Data Source, Grafana Dashboards, and Cube State Metrics in Kubernetes Monitoring

---

### **1. Adding Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana**

#### **Step: Adding Prometheus as Data Source**

The first thing you need to do after installing Grafana is to set **Prometheus** as a data source. Grafana is a visualization tool, and it needs data from Prometheus to create charts, dashboards, and other visual representations of metrics.

#### **Why This is Required:**
Grafana uses data sources to pull metrics. In this case, Prometheus stores metrics from Kubernetes, and Grafana will pull this data to display it graphically.

#### **Command to Add Data Source:**
- In the Grafana UI, go to **Data Sources**.
- Click on **Add Your First Data Source**.
- Select **Prometheus** as the data source.
- Provide the **Prometheus server URL**, which in this case is the exposed NodePort or ClusterIP.

```plaintext
http://<minikube-ip>:31110
```

- Click **Save and Test** to ensure Grafana can successfully connect to Prometheus.

#### **Purpose:**
Connecting Grafana to Prometheus allows Grafana to retrieve metrics from Prometheus and display them in a user-friendly format.

---

### **2. Creating Grafana Dashboards**

#### **Scenario:**
Once you have connected Prometheus as a data source, you can create **Grafana Dashboards** to visualize data. Grafana provides options for creating custom dashboards or importing pre-built dashboards.

#### **Steps:**
1. In the Grafana UI, go to **Dashboards**.
2. Click on **Import** to use pre-built dashboards.

Grafana has a collection of pre-built dashboards. One common and useful dashboard is **ID: 3662**, which is specifically designed for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.

- **Command**: Import Dashboard ID `3662` from Grafana.com.

```plaintext
ID: 3662
```

- **Load and Import** the dashboard into Grafana.

#### **Purpose:**
This pre-built dashboard pulls commonly used metrics from your Kubernetes cluster, such as API server health, node status, and replica sets, and displays them in a visually understandable format. It automatically executes **Prometheus queries** and presents the data.

---

### **3. Understanding PromQL Queries in Grafana**

#### **Scenario:**
Grafana dashboards are powered by **PromQL queries**. These queries are executed in Prometheus to retrieve data. Prometheus can show metrics in raw formats like JSON, but Grafana transforms them into easy-to-read charts and graphs.

#### **PromQL Query Example:**

```plaintext
up{job="kubernetes-nodes"}
```

This query returns the uptime of Kubernetes nodes. In Grafana, this is displayed as a time-series chart showing the uptime status over a defined period.

#### **Purpose:**
PromQL queries allow for flexible monitoring of different aspects of Kubernetes clusters, such as node health, pod status, and application performance. Grafana takes these queries and turns them into real-time visualizations for easier monitoring.

---

### **4. Cube State Metrics: Advanced Kubernetes Monitoring**

#### **What is Cube State Metrics?**
**Cube State Metrics** provides detailed Kubernetes object state metrics, such as information about deployments, pods, and services, which is not available through the standard Kubernetes API.

#### **Command to Expose Cube State Metrics:**
To expose Cube State Metrics as a service:

```bash
kubectl expose service prometheus-cube-state-metrics --type=NodePort --name=prometheus-cube-state-metrics-ext --namespace=default
```

#### **Why is This Needed:**
The **Kubernetes API server** only exposes limited metrics, such as CPU usage, memory, and node status. **Cube State Metrics** adds valuable insights, such as deployment replica statuses, pod readiness, and service health, which are critical for deeper monitoring.

#### **How to Access Cube State Metrics:**
Once exposed, you can access Cube State Metrics at the NodePort it is running on (e.g., `30421`).

```plaintext
http://<minikube-ip>:30421
```

#### **Purpose:**
Cube State Metrics allows you to track specific Kubernetes resources like deployments and pods more effectively, offering enhanced visibility into the state of Kubernetes applications and ensuring better operational control.

---

### **5. Prometheus Queries for Kubernetes Monitoring**

#### **Scenario:**
By default, Prometheus exposes a set of standard Kubernetes metrics such as node health, pod CPU usage, and memory consumption. However, Cube State Metrics provides additional details like the number of running replicas and deployment statuses.

#### **Example PromQL Queries:**
- **Node Health**:

```plaintext
sum(up{job="kubernetes-nodes"})
```

- **Pod Memory Usage**:

```plaintext
container_memory_usage_bytes{namespace="default", pod="mypod"}
```

These queries provide detailed insights into the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster. Grafana visualizes these queries for better monitoring.

#### **Purpose:**
Running these queries in Grafana provides a continuous, real-time view of Kubernetes health. With the help of Cube State Metrics, you get additional details about Kubernetes object states, ensuring you are not just monitoring system health but also the state of applications and workloads running inside Kubernetes.

---

### **6. Installing and Exposing Grafana in NodePort Mode**

#### **Steps to Install Grafana with Helm:**

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install grafana grafana/grafana
```

- This installs Grafana on your Kubernetes cluster.
- After installation, retrieve the admin password using:

```bash
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
```

- Expose Grafana using NodePort:

```bash
kubectl expose service grafana --type=NodePort --name=grafana-ext --namespace=default
```

- Access Grafana UI using:

```plaintext
http://<minikube-ip>:31281
```

#### **Purpose:**
Exposing Grafana using NodePort allows external access to the **Grafana UI**. This setup lets you visualize Kubernetes metrics using dashboards and offers real-time monitoring of your cluster.

---

### **Conclusion: Key Concepts**

- **Prometheus** collects metrics from Kubernetes and other applications.
- **Grafana** visualizes these metrics, turning raw data into insightful dashboards.
