Sure! Let's break down `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in Docker into simple terms to make it easy to understand.

### What Are `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`?

Both `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` are instructions you can use in a Dockerfile to define what command should run when you start a Docker container. However, they serve slightly different purposes.

### 1. **What is `ENTRYPOINT`?**

- **Purpose**: Think of `ENTRYPOINT` as the main command that you always want to run when the container starts. It is like saying, "This is what my container is primarily designed to do."

- **Key Feature**: You **can't change** or override `ENTRYPOINT` when you run the container. This means that this command is fixed and will always run unless you specifically override it using a special way.

**Example**:
If you set:
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]
```
Every time you start your container, it will always run the command `python3 app.py`.

### 2. **What is `CMD`?**

- **Purpose**: `CMD` provides default arguments or commands to run when you start the container. It is more flexible and can be changed by the user when they run the container.

- **Key Feature**: You **can change** what `CMD` does when you start the container. This allows users to provide different options without needing to modify the Dockerfile.

**Example**:
If you set:
```dockerfile
CMD ["run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```
By default, when the container is started, it will run `run --host=0.0.0.0`. However, if you run your Docker container with the command:
```bash
docker run myimage run --host=127.0.0.1
```
It will override the `CMD` part and run `run --host=127.0.0.1` instead.

### Putting It All Together

#### Combining `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`

You can use both together:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

In this case:
- **`ENTRYPOINT`** is fixed as `python3`. You can't change that.
- **`CMD`** is `app.py`, which means by default it will run `python3 app.py`. 

However, if someone runs the container like this:
```bash
docker run myimage script.py
```
It will execute `python3 script.py` instead of `python3 app.py`. 

### Summary

- **`ENTRYPOINT`**: The main command to run. It's fixed and canâ€™t be easily changed.
  
- **`CMD`**: Default options for that command. It can be changed when you run the container.

This combination gives you a lot of flexibility. You can enforce the main behavior of your app with `ENTRYPOINT` while still allowing the users to customize how the app runs with different parameters using `CMD`.
