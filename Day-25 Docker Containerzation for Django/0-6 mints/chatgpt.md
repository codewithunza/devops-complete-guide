Let's break down each concept mentioned in your text, explain them in detail, provide the commands used, their outputs, and scenarios where these concepts apply.

### 1. **Django Application Basics**

**Concept:** A Django application is a web application framework written in Python that allows for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

**Explanation:**
- Django is used to build web applications ranging from simple to complex.
- It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, which separates the business logic from the user interface.

**Scenario:**
- Whether you're working with a single-page application or a multi-page application, as a DevOps engineer, the approach to containerizing a Django app remains consistent.

**Command Example:**
- To start a new Django project:
  ```sh
  django-admin startproject myproject
  ```
- To start a new Django app within a project:
  ```sh
  python manage.py startapp myapp
  ```

**Output Example:**
```sh
myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
myapp/
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
```

**Scenario:**
- Use these commands to set up your Django project and application structure. This structure is crucial for organizing your code and scaling your application.

### 2. **Understanding Application Workflow as a DevOps Engineer**
