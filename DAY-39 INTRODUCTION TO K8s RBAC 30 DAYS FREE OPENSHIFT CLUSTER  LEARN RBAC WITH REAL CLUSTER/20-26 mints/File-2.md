### Accessing and Using OpenShift Sandbox

Here's a detailed breakdown of how to use the OpenShift Sandbox, including logging in, navigating the UI, and performing operations within the cluster.

#### **Logging into OpenShift Sandbox**

- **Concept**:
  - When you log into the OpenShift Sandbox, you gain access to a shared OpenShift cluster for a 30-day period. This cluster is pre-configured and available for you to practice and explore OpenShift and Kubernetes functionalities.

- **Scenario**:
  - After logging in, you'll see an OpenShift dashboard with both developer and administrative tabs. Your access is limited based on the role assigned by the sandbox environment, and you will typically have access to a specific namespace allocated for your use.

- **Command Output**:
  No specific command output here, but you'll see a UI with options to manage and view your cluster resources.

#### **Navigating the OpenShift UI**

- **Concept**:
  - The OpenShift UI allows you to interact with the cluster, view resources, and perform administrative tasks. You will have access to a specific namespace where you can create and manage resources like Pods and Deployments.

- **Scenario**:
  - In the UI, you can switch between namespaces, view workloads (Pods, Deployments), and manage these resources using the graphical interface.

- **Command Output**:
  Not applicable to UI navigation.

#### **Copying Login Command and Logging in via CLI**

- **Concept**:
  - OpenShift provides a way to log in via the command line interface (CLI) using a display token. This allows you to interact with the cluster using `oc` commands.

- **Scenario**:
  - Once logged into the OpenShift UI, you can copy the login command, which includes a display token. This token is used to authenticate your CLI session.

- **Command Example**:
```bash
  oc login --token=<display-token> --server=https://<api-server>
```
  - **Explanation**: Replace `<display-token>` with the token you copied from the OpenShift UI and `<api-server>` with the API server URL. This command logs you into the OpenShift cluster from the CLI.

#### **Listing Pods in Namespace**

- **Concept**:
  - Using `kubectl` or `oc` commands, you can list Pods running in a specific namespace.

- **Scenario**:
  - To view all the Pods in your namespace, you use the `get pods` command.

- **Command Example**:
```bash
  kubectl get pods
```
  - **Output**:
```plaintext
    NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-7d5f6c4d7-xb9jt   1/1     Running   0          5m
```
  - **Explanation**: Lists Pods with their names, statuses, and other details. You will only see Pods within your allocated namespace.

#### **Creating a Deployment**

- **Concept**:
  - Deployments manage the deployment of applications in Kubernetes. You can create a Deployment to run a specified container image.

- **Scenario**:
  - To create an NGINX Deployment, you use the `kubectl create deployment` command with the desired image.

- **Command Example**:
```bash
  kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```
  - **Output**:
```plaintext
    deployment.apps/nginx created
```
  - **Explanation**: Creates a Deployment named `nginx` using the `nginx` image. The Deployment will automatically create Pods to run the specified image.

#### **Viewing Deployments in UI**

- **Concept**:
  - In the OpenShift UI, you can view and manage Deployments. The UI provides an easy way to see the status of your Deployments and scale them as needed.

- **Scenario**:
  - After creating a Deployment via CLI, you can verify its existence and manage it through the OpenShift UI.

- **Command Output**:
  Not applicable to UI interactions.

#### **Scaling Pods**

- **Concept**:
  - Scaling a Deployment adjusts the number of Pods running. You can scale Pods up or down depending on the workload.

- **Scenario**:
  - To scale a Deployment from 1 Pod to 2 Pods, you use the `scale` command.

- **Command Example**:
```bash
  kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=2
```
  - **Output**:
```plaintext
    deployment.apps/nginx scaled
```
  - **Explanation**: Updates the `nginx` Deployment to run 2 Pods instead of 1. The change can be monitored in the UI or via `kubectl get pods`.

#### **Exploring OpenShift Features**

- **Concept**:
  - OpenShift allows you to explore various Kubernetes features such as Ingress, Services, Persistent Volumes, and more. You can use these features to get hands-on experience with Kubernetes operations.

- **Scenario**:
  - In addition to basic RBAC concepts, you can experiment with creating Ingress resources for routing, setting up Services for exposing applications, and managing storage with Persistent Volumes.

- **Command Examples**:
  - **Creating a Service**:
```bash
    kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=80
```
  - **Creating an Ingress**:
```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: nginx-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: nginx
                port:
                  number: 80
```
  - **Creating a Persistent Volume**:
```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: pv-example
    spec:
      capacity:
        storage: 1Gi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      hostPath:
        path: /mnt/data
```

#### **Using OpenShift for Learning and Exploration**
