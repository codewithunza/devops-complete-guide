Let's break down and explain each concept, command, and scenario related to configuring CloudWatch alarms based on the information provided:

### 1. **Understanding CloudWatch Metrics**

#### **Concept:**

- **CloudWatch Metrics**:
  - Metrics are data points collected by CloudWatch that reflect the performance and health of AWS resources. They can be displayed in various formats like graphs, pie charts, and bar charts.

#### **Explanation:**

- **Viewing Metrics**:
  - CloudWatch allows you to view metrics in different visual formats to make it easier to understand the data. You can choose between line charts, pie charts, and bar charts based on your preference.

#### **Commands and Outputs:**

- **Switching Metric Visualization**:
  - In the CloudWatch console, you can switch between different visualization types. This is done by selecting the desired chart type from the visualization options.

- **Example**:
  - **Line Chart**: Displays metrics over time.
  - **Bar Chart**: Compares metrics across categories.
  - **Pie Chart**: Shows the proportion of different metrics.

### 2. **Using Average vs. Maximum Metrics**

#### **Concept:**

- **Average vs. Maximum Metrics**:
  - Average metrics smooth out fluctuations over time, showing a more stable view. Maximum metrics show the peak values reached.

#### **Explanation:**

- **Average Metrics**:
  - Useful for understanding the overall performance over a period. For example, if CPU usage spikes briefly but averages out, the average metric will reflect this.

- **Maximum Metrics**:
  - Useful for identifying the highest usage over a period. This can help in understanding peak load situations.

#### **Commands and Outputs:**

- **Viewing Average Metrics**:
  - Set the metric to display the average over a specified time frame (e.g., 5 minutes).
