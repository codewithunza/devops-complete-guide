 ```shell
    aws sns subscribe --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:CloudWatchAlerts --protocol email --notification-endpoint your-email@example.com
 ```

**Scenario**: Configure SNS to send an email alert if the CPU utilization alarm is triggered. This ensures that team members are notified even if they are not actively monitoring the dashboard.

### **4. Configuring Alarms and Notifications**

**Concept**: Alarms can be configured to send notifications through various methods. It's important to set up proper alerts to ensure timely responses.

**Key Points**:
- **Alarm Actions**:
  - **Choose Actions**: Decide whether to send notifications via email, SMS, or other methods.
  - **Notification Messages**: Customize the message to include relevant information about the alert.

**Commands and Usage**:
- **Setting Up Alarm Notifications**:
  - **Example**:
 ```shell
    aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "HighCPUUtilization" --metric-name "CPUUtilization" --namespace "AWS/EC2" --statistic "Average" --period 300 --threshold 70 --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:CloudWatchAlerts
 ```

**Scenario**: In a production environment, configure alarms with average metrics and set up SNS notifications to alert the DevOps team if the CPU utilization remains high for a sustained period.

### **Summary**

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Provides data on resource performance, visualized in different formats. Use "Average" for long-term trends and "Maximum" for immediate spikes.
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Monitors metrics and triggers notifications based on thresholds. Useful for automated monitoring and alerts.
- **SNS**: Sends notifications via various methods (e.g., email). Useful for alerting team members about critical issues.

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively monitor AWS resources, set up alerts for performance issues, and ensure timely responses to potential problems.
