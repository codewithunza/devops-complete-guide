### 6. **Scaling**

**Concept:** Auto Scaling with CloudWatch

**Explanation:**
- **Definition:** Scaling involves adjusting the number of resources (like EC2 instances) based on demand.
- **Purpose:** To ensure sufficient resources are available during high demand and reduce them during low demand.
- **How CloudWatch Helps:** By providing metrics that trigger auto-scaling actions.

**Scenario:**
- Your EC2 instances experience high CPU utilization. CloudWatch can trigger auto-scaling actions to add more instances to handle the increased load.

**Commands:**

```bash
   aws autoscaling put-scaling-policy --policy-name ScaleOutPolicy --auto-scaling-group-name <auto-scaling-group-name> --scaling-adjustment 1 --adjustment-type ChangeInCapacity
```

2. **Output and Scenario:**
   - **Output:** Configures a policy to add one instance when the scaling condition is met.
