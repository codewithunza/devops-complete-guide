### Detailed Breakdown and Explanations

#### 1. **Running Final Build Spec**

**Concept:**
- **Build Spec**: A YAML file used by AWS CodeBuild to define the build commands and settings for a project.

**Explanation:**
- The final build spec should be correctly configured to ensure that the build process completes successfully. This includes defining the commands and environment settings required for the build.

**Example:**
- **Correct Build Spec**:
```yaml
  version: 0.2

  phases:
    install:
      commands:
        - echo Logging in to Docker Hub...
        - echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD | docker login -u $DOCKER_USERNAME --password-stdin $DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL
    build:
      commands:
        - docker build -t my_app/sample-python-flask-app:latest .
        - docker push my_app/sample-python-flask-app:latest
```

**Commands/Steps:**
1. **Verify and Update Build Spec**:
   - Check for syntax errors or missing commands and update as necessary.
2. **Run the Build**:
   - Trigger the build in AWS CodeBuild and verify that it completes successfully.

#### 2. **Understanding the Success in CI Pipeline**

**Concept:**
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: A practice where code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the codebase, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.

**Explanation:**
- Once the CI pipeline is successfully executed, it indicates that the code changes have been built and tested automatically, reflecting the success of the CI process.

**Example:**
- **Successful CI Build**:
  - Check Docker Hub to see the newly created Docker image.
  - The image should appear in the specified registry with the correct tags.

**Commands/Steps:**
1. **Verify Docker Hub**:
   - Go to Docker Hub > Your Repository > Check for the newly created Docker image and its tags.

- CodePipeline automates the build and deployment process. Once the pipeline is configured, any code changes in the GitHub repository trigger the pipeline, which in turn invokes CodeBuild and any subsequent deployment actions.

**Example:**
- **Automatic Invocation**:
  - Making a code change in GitHub triggers AWS CodePipeline, which then invokes AWS CodeBuild to build and push the Docker image.

**Commands/Steps:**
1. **Commit Code Change**:
   - Make a change to the code repository, such as adding a space, and commit the change.
2. **Verify Pipeline Execution**:
   - Monitor CodePipeline and CodeBuild to ensure that the pipeline triggers correctly and completes the build and deployment process.
