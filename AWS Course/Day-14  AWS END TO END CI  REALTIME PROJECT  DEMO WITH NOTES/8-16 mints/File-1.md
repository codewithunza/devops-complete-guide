       commands:
         - pip install -r requirements.txt
     build:
       commands:
         - python app.py
   artifacts:
     files:
       - '**/*'
 ```

   **Output**: This file specifies that Python 3.11 should be used, installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and runs the application.

---

### **5. Writing and Using Build Phases**

**Concept**:  
In `buildspec.yml`, each phase has specific tasks. For instance, the `install` phase is used to set up the environment, while the `build` phase executes the main build commands.

**Explanation**:  
- **Install Phase**: Used to set up the environment, such as installing necessary dependencies.
- **Build Phase**: Executes commands to build or test the application.

**Scenario**:  
For a Python application, you will use the `install` phase to install Python packages and the `build` phase to run the application or tests.

**Commands/Steps**:
1. **Install Phase Example**:
 ```yaml
   install:
     runtime-versions:
       python: 3.11
     commands:
       - pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

   **Output**: Installs Python 3.11 and dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Build Phase Example**:
 ```yaml
   build:
     commands:
       - python app.py
 ```

   **Output**: Executes the `app.py` script to start the Flask application.

### **6. Handling Sensitive Information**

**Concept**:  
Sensitive information, like API keys or credentials, needs to be managed securely. AWS provides mechanisms for handling such information safely.

**Explanation**:  
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Can be used to store and manage sensitive data like parameters and secrets securely.

**Scenario**:  
When dealing with sensitive information, such as environment variables for production, use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager to securely store and access this data during builds.

**Commands/Steps**:
1. **Access Sensitive Information**:
   - Store sensitive data in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
   - Retrieve this data in your `buildspec.yml` or CodeBuild environment using appropriate AWS services.

   **Output**: Securely access and use sensitive information without hardcoding it in your build configuration.
