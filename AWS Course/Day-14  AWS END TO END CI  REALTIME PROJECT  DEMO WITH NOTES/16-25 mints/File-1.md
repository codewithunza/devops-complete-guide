Here’s a detailed explanation of each concept and command based on the provided text:

### 1. **Directory and File Path Handling**
   - **Concept**: In a CI/CD pipeline, you may need to handle file paths carefully, especially when dealing with source code and build scripts.
   - **Explanation**: If the `requirements.txt` file is located in a nested directory, you must specify the absolute path to ensure that commands like `pip install` find the file correctly. For example:
 ```bash
     pip install -r day14/sample_python_app/requirements.txt
 ```
   - **Scenario**: If your `requirements.txt` is not in the root directory, this command will install dependencies from the file located at `day14/sample_python_app/requirements.txt`.

### 2. **Build Stage**
   - **Concept**: The build stage in CI/CD involves compiling code, building Docker images, and preparing the application for deployment.
   - **Explanation**: This stage typically includes:
     - **Changing Directories**: Moving to the correct directory where the Dockerfile and source code reside.
     - **Echo Statements**: Useful for debugging and logging. Example:
 ```bash
       echo "Building Docker image"
 ```
     - **Docker Build Command**: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile. Example:
 ```bash
       docker build -t my-image-tag .
 ```
       - `-t my-image-tag` tags the image with a name for easier reference.
     - **Docker Push Command**: Pushes the built image to a Docker registry. Example:
 ```bash
       docker push my-image-tag
 ```

### 3. **Handling Sensitive Information**
   - **Concept**: Store sensitive information securely rather than embedding it directly in scripts.
   - **Explanation**: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store allows you to store sensitive information like Docker credentials securely. Instead of hardcoding credentials in scripts, you use Parameter Store to securely access them.
   - **Commands**: 
     - To create a parameter:
 ```bash
       aws ssm put-parameter --name "DockerUsername" --value "your-username" --type "SecureString"
 ```
     - To retrieve a parameter:
 ```bash
       aws ssm get-parameter --name "DockerUsername" --with-decryption
 ```

### 4. **Service Roles and IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - **Concept**: AWS CodeBuild requires IAM roles to execute tasks on your behalf.
   - **Explanation**: An IAM role grants CodeBuild the necessary permissions to access AWS services and resources.
   - **Steps to Create a Role**:
     1. **Create Role**: Go to IAM in AWS Management Console and select "Roles". Click "Create role".
     2. **Select Service**: Choose the service that will use this role, e.g., AWS CodeBuild.
     3. **Attach Policies**: Grant the role the permissions it needs.
     4. **Name the Role**: Example name: `CodeBuildServiceRole`.

### 5. **AWS CodeBuild Project Configuration**
   - **Concept**: Define build steps in a `buildspec.yml` file to automate the build process.
   - **Explanation**:
     - **Phases**: Specify commands for each phase, such as install, build, and post-build.
     - **Example `buildspec.yml`**:
 ```yaml
       version: 0.2
       phases:
         install:
           commands:
             - pip install -r day14/sample_python_app/requirements.txt
         build:
           commands:
             - echo "Building Docker image"
             - docker build -t my-image-tag .
             - docker push my-image-tag
         post_build:
           commands:
             - echo "Build is successful"
 ```
   - **Scenario**: Automate dependency installation, build Docker images, and push them to a Docker registry.

### 6. **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**
   - **Concept**: Securely store and manage sensitive configuration data and secrets.
   - **Explanation**: Parameter Store allows you to create parameters for secrets like credentials and access them securely in your CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Steps to Create Parameters**:
     1. **Navigate to Parameter Store**: In AWS Systems Manager, go to Parameter Store.
     2. **Create a Parameter**: Click "Create parameter" and enter the name, type (e.g., SecureString), and value for each parameter.

By using these concepts and commands effectively, you ensure that your CI/CD pipeline is secure, well-organized, and capable of automating the build and deployment processes efficiently.

Here’s a detailed explanation of each concept, command, and scenario based on the provided text:

### **1. Handling File Paths in Build Scripts**

**Concept:**
When specifying paths in build scripts or configuration files, you need to ensure the paths correctly point to the required files. If files are nested within folders, you must provide absolute or relative paths accordingly.

**Purpose:**
- **File Location:** Ensure that build tools or scripts can locate and access required files like `requirements.txt` during the build process.

**Steps:**
1. **Path Specification:**
   - If `requirements.txt` is located in a nested directory, provide the full path from the root or current working directory.

**Example Command:**
```sh
pip install -r day14/sample_python_app/requirements.txt
```

**Output/Scenario:**
- **Command Execution:** Installs Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` located in the specified path.
