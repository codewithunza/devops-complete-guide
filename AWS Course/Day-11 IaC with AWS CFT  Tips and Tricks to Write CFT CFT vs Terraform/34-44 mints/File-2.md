### 9. **Advanced Features**

**Concept:**
CloudFormation supports advanced features like parameter validation, mappings, conditions, and transformations for more complex scenarios.

**Example of Parameters and Conditions:**

```yaml
Parameters:
  InstanceType:
    Type: String
    Default: t2.micro
    AllowedValues:
      - t2.micro
      - t2.medium
    Description: The EC2 instance type

Conditions:
  CreateLargeInstance: !Equals [ !Ref InstanceType, t2.medium ]

Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
    Condition: CreateLargeInstance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: !Ref InstanceType
      ImageId: 'ami-0abcdef1234567890'
```

### Summary
