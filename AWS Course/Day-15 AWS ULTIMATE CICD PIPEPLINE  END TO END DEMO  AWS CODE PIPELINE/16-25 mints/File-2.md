### **1. Installing CodeDeploy Agent on EC2**

**Concept**: 
- **CodeDeploy Agent**: A software component that needs to be installed on your EC2 instance to facilitate deployment tasks. It communicates with AWS CodeDeploy to receive and execute deployment commands.

**Purpose**:
- The CodeDeploy Agent is essential for the CodeDeploy service to manage deployments to EC2 instances. Without this agent, CodeDeploy cannot communicate with or manage your EC2 instances.

---

### **2. Steps to Install the CodeDeploy Agent**

**Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1. **Log into EC2 Instance:**
   - **Concept**: Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-instance-ip
 ```
   - **Explanation**: `ssh` is used to connect to your EC2 instance securely. Replace `/path/to/your-key.pem` with the path to your PEM file and `ec2-instance-ip` with your instance's IP address.

2. **Update Packages:**
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     sudo apt update
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Updates the package lists for upgrades and new package installations. Ensures you are using the latest version of packages.

3. **Install Ruby and wget:**
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     sudo apt install ruby-full -y
     sudo apt install wget -y
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Ruby is required by the CodeDeploy agent, and `wget` is a tool used to download files from the internet.

4. **Download the CodeDeploy Agent Installation Script:**
   - **Concept**: The installation script is provided by AWS and needs to be customized with your region and bucket name.
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     wget https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/latest/install
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Downloads the CodeDeploy agent installation script from an S3 bucket. Replace `bucket-name` with your S3 bucket name and `region` with your AWS region.

5. **Give Execution Permissions to the Script:**
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     chmod +x ./install
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Grants execute permissions to the `install` script.

6. **Run the Installation Script:**
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     sudo ./install auto
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Executes the installation script. The `auto` argument installs the agent with default settings.

7. **Start the CodeDeploy Agent Service:**
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     sudo systemctl start codedeploy-agent
     sudo systemctl status codedeploy-agent
 ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `start` command initiates the CodeDeploy agent service.
     - `status` command checks if the service is running correctly.

**Scenario**:
   - **Example**: After running these commands, if the agent is not running or has errors, re-running the `systemctl start` command or reviewing error messages will help troubleshoot and resolve issues.

### **3. Permissions for EC2 Instance**

**Concept**:
- **IAM Role**: An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows your EC2 instance to interact with AWS CodeDeploy and other AWS services securely.

**Purpose**:
- **IAM Role for CodeDeploy**: This role grants the EC2 instance the necessary permissions to communicate with the CodeDeploy service, enabling it to perform deployment tasks.

**Steps to Create and Attach IAM Role**:

1. **Create IAM Role**:
   - **Concept**: Define a role with policies that grant access to CodeDeploy.
   - **Steps**:
     - Go to the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management Console.
     - Create a new role and select EC2 as the trusted entity.
     - Attach policies such as `AWSCodeDeployRole` to allow CodeDeploy actions.

2. **Attach Role to EC2 Instance**:
   - **Steps**:
     - Go to the EC2 dashboard.
     - Select the instance, click on **Actions**, and then **Security**, followed by **Modify IAM Role**.
     - Attach the role created earlier to the instance.

**Commands and Explanation**:
   - **Create IAM Role via CLI**:
 ```bash
     aws iam create-role --role-name CodeDeployEC2Role --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
     aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name CodeDeployEC2Role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Creates a role with a trust policy and attaches the necessary policy for CodeDeploy.

   - **Attach Role to EC2 via CLI**:
 ```bash
     aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --iam-instance-profile Name=CodeDeployEC2Role
 ```
   - **Explanation**: Associates the IAM role with the EC2 instance.

---

### **Summary**

- **CodeDeploy Agent**: Required for deployment tasks on EC2. Installation involves connecting to EC2, updating packages, installing Ruby, downloading and running the installation script, and starting the service.
- **IAM Role**: Grants necessary permissions to the EC2 instance for interacting with CodeDeploy. Creating and attaching the role involves setting up policies and associating the role with the instance.

This detailed breakdown covers the installation and configuration of the CodeDeploy agent on an EC2 instance and the setup of permissions needed for CodeDeploy to operate effectively.

### **AWS CodeDeploy Agent Installation**

#### **Purpose of the CodeDeploy Agent**

1. **What is the CodeDeploy Agent?**
   - **Purpose**: The CodeDeploy Agent is a software application that needs to be installed on EC2 instances. It facilitates the deployment of applications from AWS CodeDeploy to those EC2 instances.
   - **Analogy**: Similar to Jenkins agents or GitLab runners, the CodeDeploy Agent communicates between the deployment service (CodeDeploy) and the EC2 instance to ensure that applications are correctly deployed.

#### **Installing the CodeDeploy Agent**

2. **Connecting to the EC2 Instance**
   - **Purpose**: Access the EC2 instance via SSH to install and configure software.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ubuntu@ec2-instance-ip
 ```
   - **Output**: You will be logged into the EC2 instance's terminal.

   - **Scenario**: Connect to your EC2 instance to perform setup tasks, such as installing the CodeDeploy Agent.

3. **Updating Packages**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure that the system’s package list is up-to-date before installing new software.
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     sudo apt update
 ```
   - **Output**: Updates the package index files from their sources.

   - **Scenario**: Run this command to make sure you have the latest package lists for installation.

4. **Installing Required Packages**
   - **Purpose**: Install necessary software packages required for running the CodeDeploy Agent.
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     sudo apt install ruby-full -y
     sudo apt install wget -y
 ```
   - **Output**: These commands install Ruby and `wget`, which are prerequisites for running the CodeDeploy Agent installation script.

   - **Scenario**: Ruby is needed because the CodeDeploy Agent is written in Ruby, and `wget` is used to download the installation script.

```
        Replace `bucket-name` and `region` with appropriate values.
     2. **Change Permissions and Run the Script**:
```bash
        chmod +x ./install
        sudo ./install auto
```
   - **Output**: The script installs the CodeDeploy Agent on the EC2 instance.

   - **Scenario**: Download and run the CodeDeploy installation script to set up the agent on your instance.

6. **Starting the CodeDeploy Agent Service**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure that the CodeDeploy Agent service is running on the EC2 instance.
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     sudo systemctl status codedeploy-agent
     sudo systemctl start codedeploy-agent
 ```
   - **Output**: Shows the status of the CodeDeploy Agent service. If it’s not running, the second command starts the service.

   - **Scenario**: After installing the agent, you need to start it so that it can communicate with AWS CodeDeploy.

### **Configuring IAM Role for EC2 Instance**

#### **Purpose of IAM Role**

1. **IAM Role for EC2**
   - **Purpose**: An IAM (Identity and Access Management) role allows the EC2 instance to interact with AWS services like CodeDeploy. This role grants necessary permissions to the EC2 instance.

2. **Creating and Attaching an IAM Role**
   - **Purpose**: Attach an IAM role to the EC2 instance to provide it with permissions needed to communicate with CodeDeploy.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Create IAM Role**:
        - Go to the IAM console and create a role with the `AWSCodeDeployRole` policy or a custom policy with necessary permissions.
     2. **Attach Role to EC2 Instance**:
        - Select the EC2 instance, go to "Actions" > "Security" > "Modify IAM Role", and attach the created role.

   - **Scenario**: Ensure that the EC2 instance has the appropriate permissions to interact with CodeDeploy by attaching an IAM role.
