### **Concepts and Commands**

1. **Installing the CodeDeploy Agent**
   - **Concept**: The CodeDeploy agent is a software package that must be installed on your EC2 instances. It allows the instance to communicate with AWS CodeDeploy and manage deployments.
   - **Purpose**: The agent ensures that the EC2 instance can receive deployment instructions from CodeDeploy and execute them properly.
   - **Scenario**: When setting up a deployment pipeline, you need to install the CodeDeploy agent on each EC2 instance to ensure that CodeDeploy can deploy your application to those instances.

2. **SSH into EC2 Instance**
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     ssh -i path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-instance-ip
 ```
   - **Explanation**: This command uses SSH to securely connect to your EC2 instance. Replace `path/to/your-key.pem` with the path to your PEM file and `ec2-instance-ip` with the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
   - **Scenario**: You use this command to log into your EC2 instance to perform administrative tasks, such as installing software or configuring settings.

3. **Update Packages**
   - **Command**:
 ```bash
     sudo apt update
 ```
   - **Explanation**: This command updates the package index on your Ubuntu instance, ensuring that you get the latest versions of software packages.
   - **Scenario**: Before installing new software, it’s important to update the package list to ensure you have the most recent versions and security patches.

4. **Install Ruby and wget**
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     sudo apt install ruby-full -y
     sudo apt install wget -y
 ```
   - **Explanation**: These commands install Ruby and wget on your EC2 instance. Ruby is required for running the CodeDeploy agent, and wget is used to download files from the web.
   - **Scenario**: Ruby is a dependency for the CodeDeploy agent, while wget helps download the installation script.

5. **Download and Install CodeDeploy Agent**
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     wget https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/latest/install
     chmod +x ./install
     sudo ./install auto
 ```
   - **Explanation**: 
     - `wget` downloads the CodeDeploy agent installation script from an S3 bucket.
     - `chmod +x ./install` makes the script executable.
     - `sudo ./install auto` runs the installation script.
   - **Scenario**: You need to download and install the CodeDeploy agent to enable deployment capabilities on your EC2 instance.

6. **Start and Check Status of CodeDeploy Agent**
   - **Commands**:
 ```bash
     sudo service codedeploy-agent status
     sudo service codedeploy-agent start
 ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `sudo service codedeploy-agent status` checks if the CodeDeploy agent is running.
     - `sudo service codedeploy-agent start` starts the CodeDeploy agent if it is not already running.
   - **Scenario**: After installation, you need to ensure the agent is running. If it's not, starting it will enable the agent to receive and execute deployment commands.

7. **Create IAM Role for EC2 Instance**
   - **Concept**: An IAM role is required to grant permissions to your EC2 instance so it can interact with other AWS services, such as CodeDeploy.
   - **Purpose**: The role allows the EC2 instance to access CodeDeploy and other AWS resources as needed.
   - **Scenario**: You create and attach an IAM role to your EC2 instance to ensure it has the necessary permissions to communicate with AWS CodeDeploy and execute deployments.

### **Detailed Explanation and Scenarios**
