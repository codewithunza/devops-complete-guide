### Practical Example of AWS IAM with Authentication and Authorization

In this scenario, we are continuing to learn about **AWS IAM** (Identity and Access Management) and how authentication and authorization work together to grant and manage user access in AWS.

---

### 1. **Logging Out of Root Account and Signing in as an IAM User:**
   - **Step 1**: Log out of the root account.
   - **Step 2**: Go to the AWS Console and click on **Sign in**. This time, sign in as an **IAM user**, not as the root user.
   - **Step 3**: When signing in as an IAM user, you will need to provide:
     - The **account ID** (This is found in the URL or the CSV you downloaded during user creation).
     - The **IAM user credentials** (e.g., `test-user-501` and the auto-generated password).

---

### 2. **IAM User Login and Password Reset:**
   - **First-Time Login**: AWS will prompt you to reset the password on the first login. This is because the password was set to be auto-generated and requires the user to create their own secure password on the first sign-in.
   - **Step**: Enter the auto-generated password and then create a new password.
   
   **Command (For Resetting Password Using CLI)**:
 ```bash
   aws iam update-login-profile --user-name test-user-501 --password new_password --password-reset-required
 ```

---

### 3. **Testing Access Without Authorization:**
   - Once the IAM user (`test-user-501`) logs in, they can access the AWS Management Console but **cannot perform any actions** since no policies (authorizations) were attached during the user creation.
   - **Scenario**:
     - **Accessing S3**: If the user tries to create or list S3 buckets, they will encounter an **"Access Denied"** error. This is because no policy was attached to allow actions on S3.
     - **Accessing EC2**: Similarly, if the user tries to launch an EC2 instance, they will also be denied access, as no permissions were granted.

---

### 4. **Error Message:**
   - AWS gives clear error messages indicating the reason for access denial. For example:
     - **S3 Error**: “You don’t have permissions to list buckets. Please attach a policy allowing `S3:ListAllMyBuckets`.”
   
   **Key Learning**: This shows that without **authorization** (policies), the user can authenticate and log in, but cannot perform any actions on AWS resources.

---

### 5. **Fixing the Authorization:**
   - To fix the authorization issue and allow the user to perform specific actions (e.g., listing and viewing S3 buckets), we need to attach a policy to the user.

   **Steps**:
   1. Log back into AWS as the root user (or a user with sufficient permissions).
   2. Navigate to the **IAM service** in AWS.
   3. Select the user (`test-user-501`) from the list of users.
   4. Click **Add Permissions**.
   5. Attach the **S3 policy** that allows the user to list and view S3 buckets.

---

### 6. **Attaching Policies to the User:**
   - We can attach AWS-managed policies, which are predefined by AWS for common use cases. These policies simplify permissions management.
   - **Example Policy**:
     - **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess**: Grants read-only access to all S3 buckets.

   **Command (To Attach Policy via CLI)**:
 ```bash
   aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name test-user-501 --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
 ```

---

### 7. **Verifying Authorization:**
   - After attaching the policy, log back in as the **test-user-501** and try to access S3 again.
   - This time, the user will be able to:
     - **List S3 buckets**.
     - **View** the content of the buckets (read-only access).

   **Scenario**:
   - The user will now see the list of all available S3 buckets, but since they only have **read-only** access, they won’t be able to create, modify, or delete any bucket or its contents.

---

### 8. **Key Concepts Explained**:

   **Authentication**:
   - This is the process of verifying a user's identity. In this case, creating the user (`test-user-501`) allowed them to log into AWS but did not grant them any permissions to interact with AWS resources.

   **Authorization**:
   - Authorization controls what a user can do within the AWS account. By attaching the **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess** policy, we are giving `test-user-501` permission to **view** (but not modify) S3 buckets.

---

### 9. **Scenario Breakdown**:

   **Scenario 1: Authentication Without Authorization**:
   - If a user has authentication but no policies attached, they can only log in to the console but won’t be able to interact with any AWS services. This is useful to ensure that users only access what they are explicitly allowed to.

   **Scenario 2: Authorization via Policies**:
   - Once a policy is attached (e.g., `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`), the user can interact with the resources allowed by the policy. In this case, the user gains read-only access to S3 buckets.

   **Scenario 3: Using Predefined Policies**:
   - AWS provides predefined **AWS-managed policies** to simplify permissions management. Instead of writing custom policies for common tasks, these managed policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.

---

### 10. **Conclusion**:

   By the end of this practical session, you learned how to:
   - Create an IAM user with authentication (but without authorization).
   - Understand what happens when no policies are attached.
   - Attach an appropriate policy to the user to grant specific permissions (authorization).
   - Use **AWS-managed policies** for simplifying access control.

   This ensures that users only have the access necessary for their role, preventing accidental or malicious actions that could harm the AWS environment.
