**Steps:**
1. **Create a Similar Kubernetes Cluster on AWS:**
   - Use EC2 instances to create a Kubernetes cluster with the same operating system and configuration.
   - Set up the same three namespaces and deploy the same ten microservices as you had on-premises.

**Explanation:**
- **Lift and Shift:** This migration strategy involves moving applications from an on-premises environment to the cloud with minimal changes. The applications remain largely unchanged, except that they now run on the cloud platform instead of on-premises hardware.

**Advantages:**
- **Simplicity:** Minimal changes are required, making it a straightforward process.
- **Quick Migration:** Since the applications are not altered, the migration process can be faster.

**Command Example (AWS EKS):**
```bash
aws eks create-cluster \
    --name my-k8s-cluster \
    --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EKS-Cluster-Role \
    --resources-vpc-config subnetIds=subnet-12345678,subnet-abcdef01,securityGroupIds=sg-0123456789abcdef0
