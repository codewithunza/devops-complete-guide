**Concept**: Migrating a Kubernetes cluster from on-premises to the cloud involves creating an identical environment on AWS and deploying your applications there.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Current State**: You have a Kubernetes cluster with three namespaces and ten microservices deployed as pods on-premises.
- **Migration Process**: You will set up a similar Kubernetes cluster on AWS using EC2 instances with the same operating system. You’ll then create the same three namespaces and deploy the ten microservices into this new cluster.

**Scenario**:
- **Example**: You have a Kubernetes cluster running on VMware infrastructure. You need to migrate this cluster to AWS. You create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using EC2 instances, ensuring that the environment (OS, configurations) matches your on-premises setup. You then deploy the same applications (microservices) to this new cluster.

**Command Example**:
To create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, you might use `eksctl`:

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-west-2 --nodegroup-name standard-workers --node-type t2.medium --nodes 3 --nodes-min 1 --nodes-max 4 --managed
```

**Output Example**:
```plaintext
[ℹ]  eksctl version 0.99.0
[ℹ]  using region us-west-2
[ℹ]  setting availability zones to [us-west-2a us-west-2b us-west-2c]
...
[✔]  EKS cluster "my-cluster" in "us-west-2" has been created
```

**Purpose**: This command sets up an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster on AWS, which is suitable for running your microservices in the cloud.

#### **2. Lift and Shift (Rehost)**

**Concept**: Rehost involves moving applications from on-premises to the cloud with minimal changes.
