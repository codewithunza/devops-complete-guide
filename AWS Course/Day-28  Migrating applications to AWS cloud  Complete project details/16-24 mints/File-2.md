**Purpose:**
- **Choosing Strategy:** The right strategy depends on factors like application architecture, dependencies, and desired outcomes. It ensures that the migration aligns with organizational goals and cloud capabilities.

### 3. **Migration Execution and Monitoring**

**Concept:**
- **Execution:** Actual migration involves moving applications, creating infrastructure, and setting up environments in the cloud.
- **Monitoring:** Post-migration, applications are monitored for performance, stability, and functionality.

**Scenario:**
- **Scripts:** Writing scripts for automation (e.g., Terraform for infrastructure setup, shell scripts for instance management).
- **Monitoring Tools:** Using tools like AWS CloudWatch for tracking performance and logs.

**Commands and Outputs:**

    instance_type = "t2.micro"
  }
```
  - **Output:** Creates an EC2 instance as specified.

- **CloudWatch Setup Example:**
