### Detailed Explanation of Commands and Concepts

#### 1. **Using SCP to Copy Files**

   - **Concept**: `scp` (Secure Copy Protocol) is used to securely transfer files between hosts over SSH.
   - **Explanation**:
     - **Purpose**: To copy a PEM file (private key) from your personal laptop to the Bastion Host so you can use it to SSH into private instances.
     - **Command**: `scp -i [Your-Private-Key.pem] [File-To-Copy] [User]@[Destination-Host]:[Destination-Path]`
       - `-i [Your-Private-Key.pem]`: Specifies the SSH private key used for authentication.
       - `[File-To-Copy]`: Path of the file you want to copy.
