### **1. Introduction to Cloud Cost Optimization via Resource Deletion**

**Concept**: The focus of this project is to implement cloud cost optimization using **Lambda functions** to automatically delete stale resources such as unused EBS snapshots. Instead of just sending notifications using **SNS**, this approach directly removes unnecessary resources to reduce costs.

**Details**:
- **Lambda Functions**: These are event-driven, serverless functions where Python code is commonly used by DevOps engineers to perform tasks like identifying and deleting unused resources.
- **Boto3**: A Python library used to interact with AWS APIs, allowing Lambda functions to communicate with AWS services such as EC2 for managing resources like EBS volumes and snapshots.

**Scenario**: 
- A developer creates an EC2 instance with attached EBS volumes and regularly backs them up using snapshots. Later, the developer deletes the EC2 instance but forgets to remove the volumes and snapshots. This leads to unnecessary costs, which could have been prevented by automatically deleting the unused snapshots.

**Commands**:
- **Create a Lambda Function**:
```bash
  aws lambda create-function --function-name DeleteStaleSnapshots --runtime python3.8 --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/my-role --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

### **2. Architecture of the Cloud Cost Optimization Solution**

**Concept**: The architecture is simple and efficient. The Lambda function interacts with AWS services through APIs, retrieves information about stale snapshots, and deletes them based on specific conditions.

**Architecture Flow**:
1. **Lambda Function**: Written in Python, the function fetches all EBS snapshots.
2. **API Interaction**: The Python code, using the **Boto3** library, interacts with AWS APIs to gather details about the EBS snapshots.
3. **Snapshot Filtering**: The function filters out snapshots that are no longer attached to active volumes or instances.
4. **Deletion**: Once the stale snapshots are identified, the Lambda function deletes them to save costs.

**Commands**:
- **Delete a Snapshot using Boto3**:
```python
  import boto3
  def delete_snapshot(snapshot_id):
      ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
      ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
```

**Scenario**: 
- A developer has deleted an EC2 instance, but snapshots associated with its EBS volume still exist. The Lambda function identifies these stale snapshots, filters out the ones no longer attached to any instance, and deletes them automatically.

---

### **3. Python Code in Lambda Functions for Cost Optimization**

**Concept**: DevOps engineers typically write Lambda functions using Python, as it's widely understood and efficient for automating AWS tasks. The core of this solution involves fetching, filtering, and deleting unused EBS snapshots using the AWS SDK (**Boto3**).

**Details**:
- **Lambda and Boto3**: The Lambda function uses Boto3 to fetch details about all EBS snapshots and checks if they are attached to any EC2 instances.
- **Triggering via CloudWatch**: The Lambda function can be set to trigger at regular intervals via CloudWatch events.

**Commands**:
- **Set CloudWatch Trigger**:
```bash
  aws events put-rule --name DailySnapshotCleanup --schedule-expression "cron(0 10 * * ? *)"
```

**Scenario**: A Lambda function is triggered every day at 10 AM to check if there are unused EBS snapshots and delete them automatically, ensuring no unnecessary charges are incurred.

---

### **4. Project Explanation for Interviews**

**Concept**: For DevOps engineers, explaining cloud cost optimization projects is crucial in interviews. This project can be presented as a real-life example of using AWS automation to reduce cloud costs by cleaning up stale resources.

**How to Explain**:
1. **Problem Statement**: There are stale EBS volume snapshots created by developers for backup purposes. These snapshots continue to exist even after the volumes or EC2 instances have been deleted, leading to unnecessary costs.
2. **Solution**: A Lambda function that fetches all EBS snapshots using the AWS API, filters out those attached to deleted volumes or instances, and deletes them.
3. **Technologies Used**:
   - **AWS Lambda**: Serverless function to handle the automation.
   - **Boto3**: Python SDK to interact with AWS EC2 service.
   - **CloudWatch**: To schedule regular execution of the Lambda function.

**Commands**:
- **Fetch EBS Snapshots using Boto3**:
```python
  import boto3
  def fetch_snapshots():
      ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
      snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])
      return snapshots['Snapshots']
```

**Scenario**: 
- A candidate explains this project as a real-life scenario during an interview, detailing how the Lambda function automates snapshot deletion, which helps the organization save costs by cleaning up unused AWS resources.

---

### **5. Buffer Time for Snapshot Deletion**

**Concept**: In some cases, snapshots are kept for backup purposes and may need to be retained for a specific period before deletion. This can be handled by checking the timestamp of snapshot creation.

**Details**:
- **Timestamp Check**: Before deleting a snapshot, the Lambda function can check the age of the snapshot and only delete those older than a defined threshold (e.g., 6 months).
- **Condition**: By using conditional logic, you can ensure that important snapshots are not deleted prematurely.

**Commands**:
- **Check Snapshot Age**:
```python
  from datetime import datetime, timezone
  def is_snapshot_old(snapshot):
      creation_time = snapshot['StartTime']
      age = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - creation_time
      return age.days > 180
```

**Scenario**: A company requires that snapshots be retained for at least 6 months. The Lambda function checks the creation date of each snapshot and only deletes those older than 6 months, preventing premature deletion of critical backups.

---

### **6. Code Walkthrough for EBS Snapshot Cleanup**

**Concept**: The core logic of the Lambda function is to fetch all snapshots, filter out the stale ones, and delete them if they are no longer associated with active volumes or instances.

**Details**:
- **Step 1**: Fetch all EBS snapshots using the Boto3 API.
- **Step 2**: Check if the volume associated with the snapshot is still attached to an EC2 instance.
- **Step 3**: If the volume is no longer in use, delete the snapshot to reduce storage costs.

**Commands**:
- **Full Code Example**:
```python
  import boto3

  def lambda_handler(event, context):
      ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

      # Step 1: Fetch all snapshots
      snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']

      for snapshot in snapshots:
          # Step 2: Check if volume exists
          try:
              volume = ec2.describe_volumes(VolumeIds=[snapshot['VolumeId']])
          except Exception as e:
              # Step 3: Delete snapshot if volume doesn't exist
              ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot['SnapshotId'])
              print(f"Deleted snapshot {snapshot['SnapshotId']}")
```

**Scenario**: The Lambda function automatically cleans up snapshots no longer associated with any volumes or instances. This reduces the overall storage costs for the company by ensuring that old backups are not unnecessarily kept.

---

### **7. Final Demonstration Setup**

**Concept**: The complete demonstration involves creating the Lambda function, writing Python code to automate the snapshot cleanup, and setting up triggers to execute this function regularly.

**Steps**:
1. **Create Lambda Function**: Use the AWS Lambda console or CLI to create the function.
2. **Write Python Code**: Implement the snapshot cleanup logic using Boto3.
3. **Schedule via CloudWatch**: Set up a daily or weekly schedule for the Lambda function using CloudWatch.
4. **Test and Monitor**: Run the function manually first, and then monitor its performance over time as it runs automatically.

**Commands**:
- **Test Lambda Function**:
```bash
  aws lambda invoke --function-name DeleteStaleSnapshots --log-type Tail outputfile.txt
```

**Scenario**: A DevOps engineer deploys the Lambda function, runs a test to ensure it deletes unused snapshots, and then schedules the function to run daily. The engineer monitors the function via CloudWatch to ensure it operates correctly.

---

### **Conclusion**:
In this cloud cost optimization project, the Lambda function automates the deletion of unused EBS snapshots, effectively reducing unnecessary cloud storage costs. DevOps engineers can implement this solution to ensure efficient management of AWS resources, and it can be customized further with additional conditions like buffer time for retention. This project demonstrates practical, hands-on experience in managing cloud costs, a critical task for modern cloud-based organizations.

### Cloud Cost Optimization Using Lambda Functions to Delete Stale EBS Snapshots

**1. Introduction to Cost Optimization Using Lambda Functions**

- **Concept**: This part of cloud cost optimization focuses on **automating the deletion of stale EBS snapshots** using AWS Lambda functions. Snapshots that are no longer associated with active EC2 volumes increase storage costs unnecessarily. DevOps engineers automate this deletion process to manage costs effectively.
  
- **Purpose**: The goal is to write a Lambda function that automatically checks for stale EBS snapshots (those not attached to any active EC2 volume or instance) and deletes them.

- **Scenario**: A developer has created multiple EC2 instances with volumes attached. The developer takes daily snapshots of these volumes as backups. Eventually, the developer deletes the EC2 instances but forgets to delete the snapshots. The snapshots continue to incur costs even though they are no longer needed.

- **Command Example to List All EBS Snapshots**:
```bash
  aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self --query 'Snapshots[].[SnapshotId,VolumeId,StartTime]'
```
  - **Explanation**: This command lists all EBS snapshots owned by the AWS account along with the snapshot IDs, volume IDs, and creation times.
  - **Output**: Displays details of all the snapshots in the AWS account.

**2. Writing a Lambda Function to Delete Stale EBS Snapshots**

- **Architecture**:
  1. **Lambda Function**: The function is written in Python and will use the **Boto3** module to interact with the AWS API.
  2. **CloudWatch Trigger**: Lambda functions are typically event-driven. In this case, we will use **CloudWatch** to trigger the Lambda function on a schedule (e.g., every day at 10 AM).

- **Steps**:
  1. **Step 1**: Fetch all EBS snapshots using the AWS API.
  2. **Step 2**: Filter out snapshots that are no longer associated with active EC2 volumes.
  3. **Step 3**: Delete the stale snapshots.

- **Code Explanation**:
  The code for the Lambda function is written in Python using Boto3 to interact with AWS resources.

  **Python Code for Lambda Function**:
```python
  import boto3

  def lambda_handler(event, context):
      ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
      snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])
      
      for snapshot in snapshots['Snapshots']:
          # Check if snapshot is associated with a deleted volume or instance
          if not snapshot['VolumeId']:
              print(f"Deleting snapshot {snapshot['SnapshotId']}")
              ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot['SnapshotId'])
```
  - **Explanation**: This script lists all snapshots in the AWS account and checks whether they are associated with a volume. If not, the snapshot is deleted.
  - **Output**: Any snapshot that is no longer attached to an active volume is deleted.

- **Command to Delete a Specific Snapshot**:
```bash
  aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-1234567890abcdef0
```
  - **Explanation**: Deletes the snapshot with the specified snapshot ID.
  - **Output**: The specified snapshot is deleted, reducing unnecessary storage costs.

**3. CloudWatch to Trigger the Lambda Function**

- **Concept**: Instead of manually running the Lambda function, CloudWatch can be used to automatically trigger it on a schedule (e.g., daily).

- **Purpose**: This automation ensures that stale snapshots are regularly checked and deleted without manual intervention.

- **Scenario**: Every day at 10 AM, CloudWatch triggers the Lambda function to check for unused snapshots and delete them if necessary.

- **Command to Create a CloudWatch Rule to Trigger Lambda**:
```bash
  aws events put-rule --schedule-expression "rate(1 day)" --name DailySnapshotCheck
  aws events put-targets --rule DailySnapshotCheck --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:DeleteStaleSnapshots"
```
  - **Explanation**: This command creates a CloudWatch rule that triggers the Lambda function daily.
  - **Output**: The Lambda function is triggered automatically every day.

**4. Code Deployment and Execution**

- **Scenario**: Now that we have written the Lambda function and set up the CloudWatch trigger, the next step is to deploy and execute the function in AWS.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Deploy the Lambda Function**: Use the AWS Console or AWS CLI to create the Lambda function and upload the Python script.
  2. **Configure CloudWatch**: Set up the CloudWatch event to trigger the Lambda function.

- **Command to Deploy Lambda Function**:
```bash
  aws lambda create-function \
    --function-name DeleteStaleSnapshots \
    --runtime python3.8 \
    --role arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/service-role/MyLambdaRole \
    --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
    --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```
  - **Explanation**: Deploys the Lambda function using a ZIP file containing the code.
  - **Output**: The Lambda function is created and ready to run.

**5. Dealing with Snapshot Expiration and Backup**

- **Concept**: You may want to keep some snapshots as backups for a specific period before deleting them. In this case, you can modify the script to check the age of the snapshot and only delete snapshots older than a certain date.

- **Scenario**: You want to delete snapshots that are more than 6 months old and not attached to any volumes.

- **Code Modification**:
```python
  import boto3
  from datetime import datetime, timedelta

  def lambda_handler(event, context):
      ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
      snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])
      six_months_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=180)

      for snapshot in snapshots['Snapshots']:
          snapshot_date = snapshot['StartTime'].replace(tzinfo=None)
          if snapshot_date < six_months_ago and not snapshot['VolumeId']:
              print(f"Deleting snapshot {snapshot['SnapshotId']}")
              ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot['SnapshotId'])
```
  - **Explanation**: This code deletes snapshots that are older than 6 months and are not associated with any active volumes.
  - **Output**: Only snapshots that are both stale and old are deleted.

**6. Monitoring and Notifications Using SNS**

- **Concept**: After the Lambda function performs the deletion, you may want to send a notification to your team to inform them of the actions taken.

- **Purpose**: Notifications keep teams informed about resource deletions and ensure that no critical data is accidentally deleted.

- **Command to Send SNS Notification**:
```python
  import boto3

  def lambda_handler(event, context):
      sns = boto3.client('sns')
      message = "Stale EBS snapshots have been deleted."
      sns.publish(TopicArn='arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:myTopic', Message=message)
```
  - **Explanation**: Sends a notification via Amazon SNS after stale snapshots are deleted.
  - **Output**: The team receives an email or SMS notification.

**7. Conclusion and Real-Life Application**

- **Concept**: Automating cloud cost optimization tasks like deleting stale EBS snapshots is critical for managing cloud infrastructure efficiently. DevOps engineers use Lambda functions and CloudWatch to ensure that cloud resources are used optimally.

- **Purpose**: By automating this process, organizations can significantly reduce their cloud bills by eliminating unused and unnecessary resources.

- **Scenario**: In a real-world scenario, the Lambda function runs daily, checks for stale EBS snapshots, deletes them, and sends a notification to the team.

### Summary of Key Points

1. **Problem Statement**: Stale EBS snapshots increase cloud costs if not deleted.
2. **Solution**: A Lambda function written in Python that deletes stale snapshots.
3. **Automation**: CloudWatch triggers the Lambda function daily to automate the process.
4. **Notifications**: Use SNS to notify teams when snapshots are deleted.
5. **Real-Life Impact**: This process is crucial for maintaining cost-efficient cloud environments.
