### Detailed Breakdown of Cloud Cost Optimization Using AWS Lambda and EBS Snapshots

#### **1. Introduction to the Scenario**
- **Concept**: The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to automate **cloud cost optimization** by deleting stale **EBS snapshots** using an **AWS Lambda function**.
- **Scenario**: A developer creates an **EC2 instance** with an attached volume and regularly takes **snapshots** for backup purposes. Over time, the developer deletes the EC2 instance but forgets to delete the snapshots, which continue to incur costs.

#### **2. Setting Up the Environment**
- **Step 1**: Create an EC2 instance and EBS volume.
  
  **Command to Launch EC2 Instance**:
```bash
  aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-12345678 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name MyKeyPair
```
  - **Explanation**: This command launches a `t2.micro` instance. When the instance is launched, a default EBS volume is automatically attached.
  - **Purpose**: This is the setup for simulating the scenario where the developer is using an EC2 instance with an attached EBS volume.

- **Step 2**: Create an EBS snapshot from the volume of the EC2 instance.
  
  **Command to Create EBS Snapshot**:
```bash
  aws ec2 create-snapshot \
    --volume-id vol-0123456789abcdef0 \
    --description "Backup snapshot for cost optimization demo"
```
  - **Explanation**: The command takes a snapshot of the EBS volume attached to the EC2 instance.
  - **Output**: Creates a snapshot that can later be used to restore the volume or data.

#### **3. Creating the Lambda Function for Cost Optimization**
- **Step 3**: Writing the Lambda function to identify and delete stale snapshots.

  **Python Code for Lambda Function**:
```python
  import boto3

  def lambda_handler(event, context):
      ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
      
      # Describe all snapshots
      snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']
      
      for snapshot in snapshots:
          # Check if the snapshot is not associated with any volume (stale)
          if not snapshot.get('VolumeId'):
              print(f"Deleting snapshot: {snapshot['SnapshotId']}")
              ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot['SnapshotId'])
```
  - **Explanation**: This Lambda function uses the **Boto3** library to describe all EBS snapshots in the AWS account and deletes the ones that are not associated with any active volume.
  - **Purpose**: The function automates the detection and removal of snapshots that no longer serve any purpose, optimizing cloud storage costs.

#### **4. Executing the Lambda Function**
- **Step 4**: Deploy the Lambda function and configure it.
  1. **Create the Lambda function**.
  2. **Set execution time**: The default execution time for Lambda functions is 3 seconds, but you can increase it to accommodate longer-running tasks.

  **Command to Deploy Lambda Function**:
```bash
  aws lambda create-function \
    --function-name EBS-Snapshot-Cleanup \
    --runtime python3.8 \
    --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLambdaRole \
    --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
    --zip-file fileb://lambda_function.zip
```
  - **Explanation**: This command creates the Lambda function, uploading the Python script and assigning it the appropriate IAM role.
  - **Output**: A Lambda function is created that can now be invoked manually or via scheduled events.

#### **5. Configuring IAM Permissions for the Lambda Function**
- **Step 5**: Attach the necessary IAM policies to the Lambda functionâ€™s role to allow it to describe and delete snapshots.

  **IAM Policy for Snapshot Permissions**:
```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
          "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
```
  - **Explanation**: This policy allows the Lambda function to list (`DescribeSnapshots`) and delete (`DeleteSnapshot`) EBS snapshots.
  - **Command to Attach Policy**:
```bash
    aws iam put-role-policy \
      --role-name MyLambdaRole \
      --policy-name EBS-Snapshot-Cleanup-Policy \
      --policy-document file://policy.json
```
    - **Purpose**: This grants the Lambda function the permissions needed to interact with EBS snapshots.

#### **6. Testing the Lambda Function**
- **Step 6**: Invoke the Lambda function to test its behavior.

  **Command to Test Lambda**:
```bash
  aws lambda invoke \
    --function-name EBS-Snapshot-Cleanup \
    output.txt
```
  - **Explanation**: This command manually triggers the Lambda function and saves the output in a text file.
  - **Output**: The function will attempt to describe and delete stale snapshots.

#### **7. Automating the Lambda Function with CloudWatch**
- **Step 7**: Use **CloudWatch** to schedule the Lambda function to run daily.

  **Command to Schedule Lambda with CloudWatch**:
```bash
  aws events put-rule \
    --schedule-expression "rate(1 day)" \
    --name DailySnapshotCleanup
  aws events put-targets \
    --rule DailySnapshotCleanup \
    --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:EBS-Snapshot-Cleanup"
```
  - **Explanation**: This command creates a CloudWatch rule to trigger the Lambda function every day.
  - **Purpose**: This automation ensures that stale snapshots are regularly checked and deleted without manual intervention.

#### **8. Managing Costs and Deleting Resources**
- **Step 8**: After the demo is complete, delete the resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

  **Command to Delete the EC2 Instance**:
```bash
  aws ec2 terminate-instances \
    --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0
```
  - **Explanation**: Terminates the EC2 instance created for the demo.

  **Command to Delete the Lambda Function**:
```bash
  aws lambda delete-function \
    --function-name EBS-Snapshot-Cleanup
```
  - **Explanation**: Deletes the Lambda function to avoid further charges.
  
  **Command to Delete EBS Snapshots**:
```bash
  aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-0123456789abcdef0
```
  - **Explanation**: Manually deletes any remaining snapshots that were created for the demo.

#### **9. Real-World Use Case**
- **Use Case**: In a real-world scenario, this setup would help organizations optimize cloud storage costs by automating the cleanup of stale EBS snapshots. This is a routine task that DevOps engineers would perform to ensure efficient resource utilization.
  
- **Benefits**:
  1. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary costs associated with orphaned snapshots.
  2. **Automation**: Eliminates the need for manual intervention by automating the deletion process with Lambda and CloudWatch.
  3. **Scalability**: Can be easily scaled to manage large environments with hundreds of EC2 instances and EBS snapshots.

### Conclusion
This project showcases a practical approach to **cloud cost optimization** using **AWS Lambda** and **CloudWatch**. By automating the deletion of stale EBS snapshots, DevOps engineers can significantly reduce unnecessary storage costs. This demonstration provides a foundational understanding of how to leverage serverless architecture to improve cloud resource management.

Let's break down the provided content and explain each concept in detail. I'll also explain the commands and scenarios as required.

### 1. **Creating an EC2 Instance and EBS Snapshot**

#### EC2 Instance Creation
- **Step-by-Step Process:**
  1. **Access the EC2 Dashboard:** Go to the AWS EC2 dashboard.
  2. **Create an EC2 Instance:** Click on "Launch Instance."
  3. **Choose Configuration:** 
     - For example, select "Ubuntu" as the AMI (Amazon Machine Image).
     - Choose the instance type, such as "t2.micro."
     - Leave the default volume settings or add additional volumes if needed.
  4. **Launch the Instance:** Click on "Launch Instance."

  **Purpose:** This instance is a virtual server in AWS's cloud. The associated volume holds data, and creating an instance allows you to interact with this volume.

  **Command/Output Example:** No direct command is involved as this is done through the AWS Management Console. The output will be the creation of an EC2 instance, visible in the dashboard.

#### Creating an EBS Snapshot
- **Step-by-Step Process:**
  1. **Access EC2 Dashboard:** Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
  2. **Locate the Volume:** Find the volume attached to your instance.
  3. **Create Snapshot:**
     - Select the volume.
     - Choose "Actions" > "Create Snapshot."
     - Provide a description (e.g., "test snapshot") and click "Create Snapshot."

  **Purpose:** A snapshot is a backup of your volume. It captures the data at a specific point in time and can be used to restore or create new volumes.

  **Command/Output Example:** No direct command is used here; it is performed through the AWS Console. The snapshot's status will be "Pending" initially and then "Completed."

### 2. **Lambda Function for Cost Optimization**

#### Lambda Function Overview
- **Purpose:** A Lambda function can automate the deletion of unused EBS snapshots, reducing costs by cleaning up resources that are no longer needed.
- **Implementation:**
  1. **Create Lambda Function:**
     - Go to the AWS Lambda dashboard.
     - Click "Create Function" and name it (e.g., "cost-optimization-EBS-snapshot").
     - Select Python as the runtime.
     - Configure permissions as needed.

  **Purpose:** Lambda functions allow you to execute code in response to events without provisioning servers. This function will automate the process of deleting old snapshots.

  **Command/Output Example:**
  - **Code Upload:**
```python
    import boto3
    
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
        snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']
        
        for snapshot in snapshots:
            snapshot_id = snapshot['SnapshotId']
            volume_id = snapshot.get('VolumeId')
            
            if not volume_id:
                ec2.delete_snapshot(SnapshotId=snapshot_id)
```
  - **Output:** The function will list all snapshots, filter out those not associated with volumes, and delete them.

#### Common Issues and Fixes
1. **Timeout Error:**
   - **Issue:** Lambda functions have a default timeout of 3 seconds, which may not be sufficient.
   - **Fix:** Increase the timeout to 10 seconds in the Lambda configuration settings.

2. **Permissions Issue:**
   - **Issue:** Lambda function might lack permissions to describe or delete snapshots.
   - **Fix:** Attach an appropriate IAM policy to the Lambda execution role.

  **Command/Output Example:**
  - **Update Execution Time:**
```shell
    aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name cost-optimization-EBS-snapshot --timeout 10
```
  - **Output:** Successful update of the Lambda function configuration.

  - **Grant Permissions:**
```shell
    aws iam put-role-policy --role-name LambdaExecutionRole --policy-name SnapshotPolicy --policy-document file://policy.json
```
```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
            "ec2:DeleteSnapshot"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
```
  - **Output:** Policy attached to the IAM role, allowing Lambda to manage snapshots.

### 3. **IAM Policy Creation and Attachment**

#### Creating an IAM Policy

- **Step-by-Step Process:**
  1. **Create Policy:**
     - Go to the IAM dashboard.
     - Navigate to "Policies" and click "Create Policy."
     - Use the JSON editor to define the policy (e.g., allow describing and deleting snapshots).
     - Name and create the policy.

  **Command/Output Example:**
```shell
  aws iam create-policy --policy-name cost-optimization-EBS --policy-document file://policy.json
```
  - **Output:** Policy ARN is provided.

#### Attaching IAM Policy to Lambda Execution Role
- **Purpose:** Attach the created policy to the Lambda execution role to grant necessary permissions.

- **Step-by-Step Process:**
  1. **Attach Policy:**
     - Go to the IAM dashboard.
     - Navigate to "Roles" and find the Lambda execution role.
     - Attach the newly created policy.

  **Command/Output Example:**
```shell
  aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name LambdaExecutionRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/cost-optimization-EBS
```
  - **Output:** Policy attached successfully.
