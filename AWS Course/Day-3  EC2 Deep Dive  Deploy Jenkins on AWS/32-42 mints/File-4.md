Let's break down each concept presented in the provided content step by step, explaining each in detail, and providing command output along with their purpose and scenarios.

### 1. **SSH into the EC2 Instance with Public IP**
   - **Command**: `ssh -i AWS_login.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>`
   - **Scenario**: You want to log into your EC2 instance from your local machine using SSH. The EC2 instance was created in AWS, and you need to use a private key (.pem file) to authenticate.
   - **Explanation**: The SSH command uses the private key (`AWS_login.pem`) to establish a secure connection to the EC2 instance. The `ubuntu@<public-ip>` refers to the default user for an Ubuntu EC2 instance and its public IP address.
   - **Error**: "Permissions too open" – this occurs because the `.pem` file has sensitive information and requires stricter file permissions.

### 2. **Fixing File Permissions with `chmod`**
   - **Command**: `chmod 600 AWS_login.pem`
   - **Scenario**: The private key file has overly permissive access, which poses a security risk.
   - **Explanation**: The `chmod 600` command restricts the file so only the owner can read or write it. This is required to use the `.pem` file securely for SSH connections.
   
### 3. **Verify Logged-in User**
   - **Command**: `whoami`
   - **Output**: `ubuntu`
   - **Scenario**: After successfully logging in, this command verifies the user’s identity.
   - **Explanation**: `whoami` returns the username that is currently logged into the system.

### 4. **Switching to Root User**
   - **Command**: `sudo su`
   - **Scenario**: You want to perform administrative tasks on the instance without typing `sudo` for every command.
   - **Explanation**: This command elevates your privileges to the root user, giving you full control of the system.

### 5. **Updating the System’s Package List**
   - **Command**: `sudo apt update`
   - **Scenario**: Before installing new software, it’s a good practice to update the package lists to ensure you’re installing the latest versions.
   - **Explanation**: This command updates the package information on the instance, ensuring that all future installations will pull the latest versions from the repositories.

### 6. **Installing Java (JDK)**
   - **Command**: `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`
   - **Scenario**: Jenkins requires Java to run, so you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK).
   - **Explanation**: This command installs OpenJDK version 11, a popular choice for running Java-based applications.

### 7. **Verify Java Installation**
   - **Command**: `java -version`
   - **Output**: `openjdk version "11.0.x"`
   - **Scenario**: After installing Java, you need to confirm the installation was successful.
   - **Explanation**: This command prints the installed version of Java, verifying that Java is correctly set up.

### 8. **Installing Jenkins**
   - **Command**: Install steps from Jenkins official documentation.
   - **Scenario**: You want to install Jenkins, a popular CI/CD tool, on your EC2 instance.
   - **Explanation**: Following Jenkins' official installation instructions for Ubuntu, you install the necessary repositories and install Jenkins. This will allow you to automate various software development processes.

### 9. **Check Jenkins Service Status**
   - **Command**: `systemctl status jenkins`
   - **Output**: Shows Jenkins is "active (running)".
   - **Scenario**: You need to verify if Jenkins is up and running after installation.
   - **Explanation**: The `systemctl status` command checks whether the Jenkins service is running on your instance.

### 10. **Accessing Jenkins from Browser**
   - **URL**: `http://<public-ip>:8080`
   - **Scenario**: After installing Jenkins, you want to access the Jenkins dashboard from a web browser using the public IP and port `8080`.
   - **Explanation**: Jenkins, by default, runs on port 8080. You use the instance's public IP address to access Jenkins from your local browser. However, this may not work immediately due to security restrictions on the instance.

### 11. **Allow Port 8080 in Security Groups**
   - **Action**: Update Security Group settings to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 8080.
   - **Scenario**: Your application (Jenkins) isn’t accessible externally because the instance’s security group doesn’t allow traffic on port 8080.
   - **Explanation**: AWS Security Groups control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances. To allow access to Jenkins, you must edit the inbound rules to allow traffic on port 8080 from any IP address (`Anywhere`).

### 12. **Accessing Jenkins Initial Password**
   - **Command**: `cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
   - **Scenario**: When you first access Jenkins, it requires an initial admin password for setup.
   - **Explanation**: This command retrieves the randomly generated admin password from the Jenkins installation directory. You need this to complete the Jenkins setup process through the web interface.

### 13. **Congratulations on First Application Deployment**
   - **Scenario**: Successfully accessing the Jenkins dashboard confirms that your first application (Jenkins) has been deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.
   - **Explanation**: This marks a major milestone for AWS learners. Deploying Jenkins not only demonstrates familiarity with AWS EC2 but also shows the ability to deploy and access applications externally.

### **Summary of Key Concepts**:
1. **SSH Authentication**: Use a key pair (private key) to securely connect to your EC2 instance.
2. **File Permissions**: Use `chmod` to secure sensitive files like private keys.
3. **Root Privileges**: `sudo su` elevates your access to the system.
4. **System Updates**: Always update system packages before installing new software.
5. **Java Installation**: Java is required for Jenkins and many other applications.
6. **Jenkins Installation**: Follow official documentation to install Jenkins and ensure it’s running.
7. **Security Groups**: AWS Security Groups control access to your instance; you must allow necessary ports (like 8080 for Jenkins) to access services.
8. **Jenkins Setup**: Retrieve and use the Jenkins admin password to complete the setup.
