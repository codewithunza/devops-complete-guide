   - **Encryption**: Server-side encryption protects data at rest.

4. **Cost-Effectiveness**:
   - **Storage Costs**: Very low cost per GB of storage. Example: Storing 1 TB of data can cost around $4-$5 per month, depending on the storage class.

5. **Performance**:
   - **Multi-Part Uploads**: Allows uploading large files in parts, which can be resumed if the upload fails.

**Example of Multi-Part Upload**:
- **Large File Upload**: For uploading a 4 TB file, AWS S3’s multi-part upload allows breaking the file into 100 MB chunks, which are uploaded in parallel. This enhances upload speed and reliability.

**Scenario**:
- **Scalable Storage Needs**: If an organization needs to store a large amount of data, S3's scalability allows for seamless growth without reconfiguration.

#### 5. **Bucket Object Limits**

**Concept**:
- **Object Size Limit**: The maximum size of a single object that can be uploaded to S3 is 5 TB.

**Example**:
- **Large Object Handling**: While an `index.html` file is only a few bytes, larger files like videos or database backups can be up to 5 TB in size.

**Scenario**:
- **Handling Large Files**: For large files, use S3’s multi-part upload to manage and complete uploads efficiently.

By understanding these concepts and processes, you can effectively manage your AWS S3 buckets and leverage its features for secure, reliable, and scalable storage solutions.
