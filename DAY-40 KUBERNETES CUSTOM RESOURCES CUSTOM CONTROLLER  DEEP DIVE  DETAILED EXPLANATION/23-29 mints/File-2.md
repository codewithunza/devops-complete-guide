### 1. **Steps to Work with Custom Resources in Kubernetes**

#### **Step 1: Deploy Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**
   - **Definition**: A CRD is used to define a new type of resource in Kubernetes. It extends the Kubernetes API with new custom resource types.
   - **Purpose**: To enable Kubernetes to recognize and manage new types of resources beyond the built-in ones.
   - **Scenario**: For example, if you are using Istio and want to manage virtual services, you first need to deploy a CRD that defines what a `VirtualService` is.

   **Command to Apply CRD**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f virtualservice-crd.yaml
```

   **Example CRD YAML**:
```yaml
   apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
   kind: CustomResourceDefinition
   metadata:
     name: virtualservices.networking.istio.io
   spec:
     group: networking.istio.io
     versions:
       - name: v1alpha3
         served: true
         storage: true
     scope: Namespaced
     names:
       plural: virtualservices
       singular: virtualservice
       kind: VirtualService
       shortNames:
         - vs
```

#### **Step 2: Deploy Custom Controller**
   - **Definition**: A custom controller manages the lifecycle of custom resources defined by the CRD. It watches for changes to these resources and performs actions accordingly.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure that custom resources are properly acted upon. Without a custom controller, the CRD alone won't perform any actions.
   - **Scenario**: For Istio's `VirtualService`, the Istio controller manages the creation and updates of virtual services based on the custom resource.

   **Command to Apply Custom Controller**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f istio-controller.yaml
```

   **Example Controller Deployment YAML**:
```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: istio-controller
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: istio-controller
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: istio-controller
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: istio-controller
             image: istio/controller:latest
             ports:
               - containerPort: 8080
```

#### **Step 3: Deploy Custom Resource (CR)**
   - **Definition**: A custom resource is an instance of a type defined by a CRD. Users create custom resources to leverage the features provided by the CRD and its associated controller.
   - **Purpose**: To use the features provided by the custom controller and CRD. The custom resource contains configuration and specification data.
   - **Scenario**: After deploying the VirtualService CRD and controller, you create a `VirtualService` custom resource to define traffic routing rules.

   **Command to Apply Custom Resource**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```

   **Example Custom Resource YAML**:
```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
   kind: VirtualService
   metadata:
     name: my-virtual-service
     namespace: default
   spec:
     hosts:
     - "my-service"
     http:
     - route:
       - destination:
           host: my-service
```

### 2. **Writing Custom Controllers**

#### **Languages and Tools**
   - **Go (Golang)**: The most popular language for writing custom Kubernetes controllers. Kubernetes itself is written in Go, and the client-go library provides tools to interact with the Kubernetes API.
   - **Python and Java**: Although possible, Go is preferred due to its strong community support and performance benefits.

   **Why Go is Preferred**:
   - Kubernetes and its ecosystem, including client-go, are written in Go.
   - Go provides robust concurrency support and efficient performance.

   **Client-go**: A Go client library for Kubernetes that allows interaction with the Kubernetes API.

   **Example Go Code Using Client-go**:
```go
   package main

   import (
       "context"
       "flag"
       "fmt"
       "k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd"
       "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes"
       "k8s.io/client-go/tools/cache"
   )

   func main() {
       kubeconfig := flag.String("kubeconfig", "/home/user/.kube/config", "absolute path to the kubeconfig file")
       config, err := clientcmd.BuildConfigFromFlags("", *kubeconfig)
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }

       clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }

       podList, err := clientset.CoreV1().Pods("default").List(context.TODO(), metav1.ListOptions{})
       if err != nil {
           panic(err)
       }

       for _, pod := range podList.Items {
           fmt.Println(pod.Name)
       }
   }
```

#### **High-Level Process for Writing a Custom Controller**
   - **Setup Watchers**: Controllers use watchers to listen for changes to resources. These watchers notify the controller when a resource is created, updated, or deleted.
   - **Handle Events**: When a change is detected, the controller processes the event and performs necessary actions.
   - **Client-go Package**: Utilize the `client-go` package for interacting with the Kubernetes API. The package includes features like watchers and informers.

   **Example Process**:
   1. **Watchers**: Set up watchers to monitor specific custom resources.
   2. **Queue**: Add events to a processing queue when changes are detected.
   3. **Worker**: Process each event from the queue to perform necessary actions.

   **Frameworks**:
   - **Kubernetes Controller Runtime**: A library for building Kubernetes controllers.
   - **Operator SDK**: A tool for building operators (a specific type of controller).

   **Resources**:
   - **Documentation**: Kubernetes official documentation provides examples and tutorials for writing custom controllers.
   - **Sample Controllers**: Look for sample controllers and tutorials in Kubernetes documentation or community resources.

### 3. **Custom Resource Definitions vs. Native Resources**

   - **Native Resources**: Built-in resources like `Pod`, `Deployment`, and `Service` have predefined controllers and resource definitions in Kubernetes.
   - **Custom Resources**: Require a CRD and custom controller. The workflow involves deploying the CRD, controller, and custom resources, as opposed to using built-in Kubernetes resources.

   **Comparison**:
   - **Deployment**:
     - CRD: No need; Kubernetes has built-in resource definition.
     - Controller: Native Deployment controller handles creation and updates of Pods.

   - **Custom Resource**:
     - CRD: Required to define the custom resource type.
     - Controller: Custom controller needed to manage the custom resource and perform actions based on its state.

   **Command Outputs**:
   - **Creating a Deployment**:
```bash
     kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
     deployment.apps/nginx created
```

   - **Creating a Custom Resource**:
```bash
     kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
     virtualservice.networking.istio.io/my-virtual-service created
```

### Summary

1. **Deploy CRD**: Define new resource types for Kubernetes.
2. **Deploy Custom Controller**: Manage and act upon custom resources.
3. **Deploy Custom Resource**: Utilize the new resource type defined by the CRD.

**Custom Controllers** are written primarily in **Go**, but other languages like Python and Java can also be used. The **client-go** library facilitates interaction with Kubernetes APIs, while the **Kubernetes Controller Runtime** and **Operator SDK** provide tools for building controllers and operators.

If you want to dive deeper into writing custom controllers, exploring Go programming, and Kubernetes client libraries would be beneficial.

Here is a detailed explanation of the concepts, commands, and scenarios related to deploying and managing custom resources, custom resource definitions (CRDs), and custom controllers in Kubernetes:

### 1. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**
**Concept**: 
- A CRD is a way to extend Kubernetes' capabilities by defining a new type of API object in Kubernetes. This allows you to create custom resources that behave like native Kubernetes resources.

**Details**:
- **Purpose**: CRDs enable you to define new types of resources that can be managed like native Kubernetes resources, allowing Kubernetes to understand and manage these custom resources using its API.
- **Definition**: You define a CRD using a YAML file which specifies the schema for your custom resource.

**Example YAML for CRD**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: virtualservices.networking.istio.io
spec:
  group: networking.istio.io
  names:
    kind: VirtualService
    listKind: VirtualServiceList
    plural: virtualservices
    singular: virtualservice
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
    - name: v1alpha1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                hosts:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
                gateways:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
                http:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: object
                    properties:
                      match:
                        type: array
                        items:
                          type: object
                      route:
                        type: array
                        items:
                          type: object
```

**Scenario**: 
- If a company wants to use Istio for service mesh capabilities, they would first deploy the CRD provided by Istio to enable the Kubernetes API to understand and manage Istio's custom resources like `VirtualService`.

**Commands**:
- To create a CRD, use:
```bash
  kubectl apply -f crd.yaml
```

### 2. **Custom Resources (CRs)**
**Concept**: 
- Custom resources are instances of a CRD. They are created and managed like native Kubernetes resources, but they adhere to the schema defined by their CRD.

**Details**:
- **Purpose**: Custom resources enable users to use and manage new types of resources in their Kubernetes clusters, such as Istio's `VirtualService` resource.

**Example YAML for Custom Resource**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-virtual-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-service.default.svc.cluster.local
  gateways:
    - my-gateway
  http:
    - match:
        - uri:
            prefix: "/"
      route:
        - destination:
            host: my-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```

**Scenario**: 
- After deploying the CRD, a user can create a `VirtualService` custom resource to configure traffic routing rules for their service within Istio.

**Commands**:
- To create a custom resource, use:
```bash
  kubectl apply -f custom-resource.yaml
```

### 3. **Custom Controllers**
**Concept**: 
- Custom controllers are applications that watch for changes to custom resources and take actions based on those changes. They extend Kubernetes functionality by implementing custom logic for managing custom resources.

**Details**:
- **Purpose**: Custom controllers ensure that the desired state of a custom resource is maintained by performing actions based on the resource's state.

**Example**:
- For Istio, the custom controller watches for `VirtualService` resources and applies the appropriate configurations to the Istio service mesh.

**Popular Languages**:
- **Golang**: The most common language for writing Kubernetes controllers due to its performance and the fact that Kubernetes itself is written in Go.
- **Other Languages**: Python, Java, etc., can also be used, but Go is preferred due to its strong community support and Kubernetes libraries.

**Example High-Level Flow**:
1. **Watchers**: Set up watchers to listen for changes to custom resources.
2. **Processing**: When a change is detected, process the custom resource and take appropriate actions (e.g., updating configurations, creating resources).

**Frameworks**:
- **Client-Go**: A Go client library for interacting with Kubernetes.
- **Kubernetes Controller Runtime**: A library to simplify building Kubernetes controllers.

**Commands**:
- To build and deploy a custom controller, you typically need to:
  1. Write the controller code using Go or another supported language.
  2. Build and package the controller.
  3. Deploy the controller to the Kubernetes cluster.

**Resources for Learning**:
- **Kubernetes Controller Runtime**: Provides documentation and examples for building controllers.
- **Operator SDK**: For building Kubernetes operators, which are a specific type of controller.

### Summary

1. **CRDs**: Extend Kubernetes with new resource types.
2. **Custom Resources**: Instances of CRDs that users create and manage.
3. **Custom Controllers**: Manage the state of custom resources by performing actions based on changes.

In practice, these components work together to provide extended functionality in Kubernetes, enabling more complex and customized behaviors within the cluster.
