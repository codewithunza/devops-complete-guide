The text you've provided explains key concepts in Kubernetes related to **Custom Resources**, **Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)**, and **Custom Controllers**. Below is a detailed breakdown and explanation of each concept, along with relevant scenarios and purposes. I'll also describe the process involved and explain the outputs.

### **1. Native Kubernetes Resources vs. Custom Resources**

- **Native Kubernetes Resources**: Kubernetes comes with standard resources like `Deployment`, `Pod`, `Service`, etc. These resources are predefined and validated against a **Resource Definition** in the Kubernetes API.
  
  - **Deployment.yaml Example**:
```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```
    - **Purpose**: This file defines a deployment in Kubernetes and specifies how many replicas of the `nginx` container should be running.
    - **Scenario**: Kubernetes ensures the file conforms to the standard **Resource Definition** for a `Deployment`, creating Pods as specified.

- **Custom Resources**: These are user-defined resources that are not part of Kubernetes by default. To create them, users define their own resource types via **Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)**.
  
  - **Custom Resource Example (Istio VirtualService)**:
```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: my-service
    spec:
      hosts:
      - "my-service.example.com"
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
    - **Purpose**: This defines an Istio `VirtualService`, which is a custom resource that controls traffic routing in the service mesh.
    - **Scenario**: Custom resources like `VirtualService` enable you to extend Kubernetes capabilities, in this case adding advanced traffic management via Istio.

### **2. Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**

- **CRD**: A Custom Resource Definition is a YAML file that extends Kubernetes' API by defining new resource types that Kubernetes can understand and manage.
  
  - **CRD Example**:
```yaml
    apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
    kind: CustomResourceDefinition
    metadata:
      name: virtualservices.networking.istio.io
    spec:
      group: networking.istio.io
      versions:
      - name: v1alpha3
        served: true
        storage: true
      scope: Namespaced
      names:
        plural: virtualservices
        singular: virtualservice
        kind: VirtualService
        shortNames:
        - vs
```
    - **Purpose**: This file creates a new resource type (`VirtualService`) that Kubernetes will recognize as part of the Istio service mesh.
    - **Scenario**: Once this CRD is deployed, users can create instances of `VirtualService` in their clusters. Kubernetes will validate these resources against the CRD definition.

  - **Validation**: When you create a custom resource (e.g., `VirtualService`), Kubernetes validates it against the CRD to ensure it follows the defined structure.

  - **Command to apply CRD**:
```bash
    kubectl apply -f virtualservice-crd.yaml
```
    **Output**:
```
    customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/virtualservices.networking.istio.io created
```

### **3. Custom Controllers**

- **Custom Controllers**: While CRDs define new resource types, Custom Controllers act on those resources by watching and reconciling their desired state.

  - **Kubernetes Native Controller Example (Deployment Controller)**: When you create a `Deployment` resource, the Deployment Controller manages the lifecycle of Pods, ensuring that the desired number of replicas are always running.
  
  - **Custom Controller (for CRDs)**: A Custom Controller watches for changes in custom resources (like `VirtualService`) and acts on them. For example, the Istio controller might configure the service mesh to manage traffic routing when a new `VirtualService` is created.

  - **Scenario**: If you create a `VirtualService`, the Custom Controller will react by modifying Istio traffic rules based on the `VirtualService` definition. Without a controller, creating a custom resource alone won't trigger any actions in the cluster.

  - **Command to deploy Custom Controller**:
```bash
    helm install istio-base istio/base -n istio-system
    helm install istiod istio/istiod -n istio-system
```
    **Output**:
```
    NAME: istiod
    LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Sep  2 18:45:31 2024
    NAMESPACE: istio-system
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
```

  - **Purpose**: The Custom Controller ensures that the system behaves according to the custom resources created. It acts on the custom resource events and brings the desired state into effect.

### **4. Example Workflow for Custom Resources in Kubernetes**

#### Step-by-Step:

1. **DevOps Engineer**:
   - Deploys the **CRD** (e.g., `VirtualService`) into the cluster.
   - Command: 
```bash
     kubectl apply -f virtualservice-crd.yaml
```

2. **User (Developer/DevOps)**:
   - Creates a **Custom Resource** (e.g., `VirtualService`) that is validated against the CRD.
   - Command:
```bash
     kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```

3. **Custom Controller**:
   - Watches for the creation of the custom resource and acts accordingly (e.g., Istio manages traffic rules).
   - If no custom controller is deployed, the custom resource will just sit idle, as there is no entity watching and taking action.

4. **Outcome**:
   - Once the controller acts, the system operates according to the custom resource's specification. In the case of Istio, traffic routing and other service mesh functions come into play.

### **5. Ingress Resource Comparison**

- **Scenario Without Controller**: Just like an `Ingress` resource requires an **Ingress Controller** to manage HTTP/S traffic, a **Custom Resource** also requires a corresponding custom controller to take actions based on the resource's definition.

  - **Command to create Ingress resource**:
```bash
    kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```
    - Without an Ingress Controller, the Ingress resource would have no effect.

### **Summary of Key Concepts**:

- **CRD (Custom Resource Definition)**: A YAML file that defines a new resource type (e.g., `VirtualService`) that extends Kubernetesâ€™ capabilities.
- **CR (Custom Resource)**: A specific instance of the resource defined by the CRD (e.g., a `VirtualService` managing traffic for a particular service).
- **Custom Controller**: Watches for changes in custom resources and acts to reconcile the desired state, much like native Kubernetes controllers manage deployments and replicas.

This detailed explanation should help you understand the process of extending Kubernetes via CRDs, CRs, and Custom Controllers, along with their practical applications.

### 1. **Native Kubernetes Resources vs. Custom Resources**

- **Native Kubernetes Resources**: These are built-in Kubernetes resources such as `Deployment`, `Service`, or `Pod`. When you create a `deployment.yaml` file, Kubernetes automatically validates it against its predefined resource definition.
  
- **Custom Resources (CR)**: These are user-defined resources that extend Kubernetes' capabilities. For example, a `VirtualService` from Istio. When a user creates a custom resource, Kubernetes validates it against a **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**.

**Purpose**: Custom resources allow users to extend Kubernetes beyond its native capabilities by adding new features (like traffic routing with Istio) that are validated via CRDs.

#### Example Commands:

**Create a native resource (`Deployment`)**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

**Create a custom resource (`VirtualService`)**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```

### 2. **Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**

- **CRD**: A **Custom Resource Definition** is the specification (a YAML file) that defines a new API type in Kubernetes. It tells Kubernetes how to validate and manage the custom resources (CRs) a user creates.
  
  For example, Istio might create a `VirtualService` CRD, which defines all the possible fields and configurations for managing traffic rules.

**Purpose**: The CRD enables Kubernetes to understand and validate new types of objects, such as custom networking or storage solutions.

#### Example Commands:

**Install a CRD**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f crd.yaml
```

### 3. **Custom Resource (CR)**

- **Custom Resource**: Once a CRD is defined, users can create instances of that custom resource. For example, a user might create a `VirtualService` to define routing rules for services.
  
  The CR is validated against the corresponding CRD. If the CR matches the CRD specification, it is accepted by Kubernetes.

**Purpose**: CRs provide a way for users to interact with the new APIs created by the CRDs, allowing them to add new capabilities (like traffic routing in Istio).

#### Example Commands:

**Create a custom resource**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```

### 4. **Kubernetes Controller**

- **Native Controller**: In Kubernetes, when you create a `Deployment`, a **Deployment Controller** automatically takes care of creating the required `ReplicaSets` and `Pods`. This controller watches the state of the resources and ensures that they match the desired state.
  
- **Custom Controller**: In the case of custom resources, a **Custom Controller** is needed to watch and act on the custom resource. For instance, when you create a `VirtualService`, Istioâ€™s custom controller watches for changes to the custom resource and applies the corresponding network rules.

**Purpose**: Custom controllers are essential for managing custom resources. Without a custom controller, a custom resource would just sit idle without performing any action.

#### Example Commands:

**Deploy a custom controller (e.g., Istio Controller)**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f istio-controller.yaml
```

### 5. **CRD and Custom Controller Flow**

1. **DevOps Engineers Deploy CRD**: First, a DevOps engineer deploys the CRD (e.g., `VirtualService`) to the Kubernetes cluster. This allows Kubernetes to understand the new custom resource type.
   
2. **User Creates Custom Resource**: Then, a user (developer or DevOps engineer) creates a custom resource (e.g., a `VirtualService`) within a specific namespace.

3. **Kubernetes Validates CR**: The Kubernetes API server validates the custom resource against the CRD. If valid, it stores it in etcd, the Kubernetes backing store.

4. **Custom Controller Watches**: A custom controller (e.g., Istio Controller) continuously watches for changes to the custom resource and takes necessary actions (e.g., routing traffic as per the `VirtualService` configuration).

**Purpose**: This flow ensures that custom resources are both validated and actively managed in Kubernetes, enabling custom functionality like advanced traffic management in a service mesh.

#### Example Commands:

**Deploy a custom resource**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```

**Check if a custom resource is created**:
```bash
kubectl get virtualservice -n <namespace>
```

### 6. **Custom Resource Use Case Example**

- **Scenario**: Let's say a company is using Istio for traffic routing. To manage traffic between services, the DevOps team installs the Istio CRD (`VirtualService`), enabling the company to define traffic routing rules in their Kubernetes cluster.
  
- **User Action**: A user defines a `VirtualService` custom resource to route traffic based on certain rules (e.g., version-based routing). Without the custom controller (Istio Controller) watching this `VirtualService`, no traffic management happens. Once the controller is deployed, it watches the custom resource and applies the necessary routing changes.

#### Example Commands:

**Create a custom resource (Istio Virtual Service)**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  hosts:
  - "my-service"
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: my-service
        subset: v1
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```

**Deploy Istio controller**:
```bash
kubectl apply -f istio-controller.yaml
```

### 7. **Ingress vs. Custom Resources**

- **Ingress Resource**: Similar to custom resources, an `Ingress` resource requires an **Ingress Controller** (such as Nginx Ingress Controller) to perform any action. Without an `Ingress Controller`, the `Ingress` resource alone is useless.

- **Custom Resources**: Similarly, custom resources (e.g., `VirtualService`) need a custom controller (e.g., Istio Controller) to take action based on the CR's configuration.

**Purpose**: Both native resources like `Ingress` and custom resources require controllers to perform the desired actions.

#### Example Commands:

**Deploy Ingress Resource**:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: example-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```
