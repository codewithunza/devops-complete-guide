### Detailed Explanation of Kubernetes Custom Resources (CR), Custom Resource Definitions (CRD), and Custom Controllers

#### 1. **Comparing Native Kubernetes Resources with Custom Resources**
   **Concept**:  
   In Kubernetes, native resources like Deployments, Services, and Pods are managed by the system with built-in controllers. On the other hand, Custom Resources (CR) are user-defined extensions of Kubernetes, validated against Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). The validation and creation process for both native and custom resources follows a similar workflow:
   - **Native Resources**: Deployments are validated against Kubernetes’ internal deployment resource definitions.
   - **Custom Resources**: CRs (like Istio’s `VirtualService`) are validated against the CRD, ensuring correctness before being created in the Kubernetes cluster.

#### 2. **Steps in Creating and Validating a Custom Resource**
   **Concept**:  
   After a CRD is created and registered with Kubernetes, users can submit Custom Resources (CRs) for validation and creation. The process follows:
   - **Step 1**: Create and deploy the CRD, such as `VirtualService`, to the Kubernetes cluster. This defines the new API endpoint.
   - **Step 2**: Submit a Custom Resource (CR) that conforms to the CRD. For instance, a user creates a `VirtualService` YAML file to define a specific networking rule.
   - **Step 3**: The CR is validated against the CRD definition. If everything is correct, the CR is accepted and created in the cluster.

   **Example Scenario**:
   - **CRD Definition**: Let’s say an organization is using Istio for advanced traffic routing. A CRD for `VirtualService` is deployed to Kubernetes, allowing users to create instances of `VirtualService`.
   - **CR Creation**: A developer then creates a specific `VirtualService` CR for routing traffic to a service.

#### 3. **The Role of Kubernetes Controllers**
   **Concept**:  
   Native Kubernetes resources, like Deployments, are managed by built-in controllers. For example:
   - **Deployment Controller**: Ensures the desired number of replicas are maintained by creating Pods.
   - **ReplicaSet Controller**: Manages the Pods associated with a deployment.

   Similarly, for Custom Resources, **Custom Controllers** are required. Once a CR is created, it doesn’t perform any action by itself. A controller must monitor the CR and take the required actions.

   **Example**:
   - **Native Deployment**: When a `Deployment` resource is created, the Deployment Controller ensures that the requested number of Pods is up and running.
   - **Custom Resource**: If you deploy a `VirtualService` CR, Istio’s custom controller watches for this CR and performs actions like configuring traffic routes in the cluster.

#### 4. **Why is a Custom Controller Required?**
   **Concept**:  
   After creating a Custom Resource (CR), it will just sit in the cluster unless a controller is watching it and performing actions. A Custom Controller is essential to ensure that the CR behaves as intended, performing necessary actions like traffic routing or service mesh configuration.

   **Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: A DevOps engineer deploys the CRD (e.g., `VirtualService` CRD).
   - **Step 2**: A user creates a Custom Resource (e.g., `VirtualService` CR).
   - **Step 3**: The CR is validated against the CRD.
   - **Step 4**: A Custom Controller, deployed to the Kubernetes cluster, monitors the CR. Once the controller sees the CR, it executes the required actions, such as traffic management (in the case of Istio’s service mesh).

   **Example Command (CRD Deployment)**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/
```

   **Example Command (Deploying Custom Resource)**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f virtual-service.yaml
```

   **Virtual Service YAML Example**:
```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
   kind: VirtualService
   metadata:
     name: my-virtual-service
   spec:
     hosts:
     - "example.com"
     http:
     - route:
       - destination:
           host: my-service
           port:
             number: 80
```

   **Explanation**:
   - **Step 1**: The DevOps engineer deploys the `VirtualService` CRD (custom resource definition) to allow the creation of `VirtualService` resources.
   - **Step 2**: A user creates a `VirtualService` CR (custom resource) in a specific namespace (e.g., `Abhishek`).
   - **Step 3**: Kubernetes API validates the CR against the `VirtualService` CRD.
   - **Step 4**: A custom Istio controller is deployed, which monitors the CR and applies the specified traffic rules.

#### 5. **Deploying the Custom Controller**
   **Concept**:  
   After deploying the CRD and the CR, you need to ensure that a **Custom Controller** is watching the CR. The Custom Controller can be deployed across the entire Kubernetes cluster or restricted to a specific namespace.

   **Example Scenario**:
   - In the `Abhishek` namespace, the DevOps engineer deploys an Istio custom controller that reads `VirtualService` resources and configures service mesh features like Mutual TLS or traffic routing.

   **Command Example (Deploying Custom Controller)**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f istio-controller.yaml
```

   **Controller YAML Example**:
```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: istio-controller
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: istio-controller
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: istio-controller
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: controller
           image: istio-controller:latest
```

   **Explanation**:
   This YAML file creates a deployment for the Istio controller. The controller watches the custom resources (like `VirtualService`) and executes the actions specified in them, such as configuring traffic rules.

#### 6. **Key Takeaways**:
   - **CRD**: Defines a new API resource for Kubernetes.
   - **CR**: An instance of the new resource, like `VirtualService`.
   - **Custom Controller**: Automates actions based on the custom resource, ensuring that the CR’s intended behavior is realized.

By comparing the custom resource workflow with native resources, we can see that both require controllers for enforcement. Custom resources require custom controllers to watch, validate, and take action, just like built-in resources in Kubernetes.
