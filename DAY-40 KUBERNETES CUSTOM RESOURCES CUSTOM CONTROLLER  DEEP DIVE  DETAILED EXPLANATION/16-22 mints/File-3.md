Let's break down each concept presented in the provided text to explain in-depth and in simple terms. This includes custom resources, custom controllers, and the steps involved in deploying and managing them in a Kubernetes environment. We'll also look at comparisons with native Kubernetes resources like `Deployment` and how these concepts work together.

### 1. **Native Kubernetes Resource vs. Custom Resource**
   - **Native Resource**: A resource like `Deployment`, `Service`, or `Pod` is already built into Kubernetes. When you create a `Deployment`, Kubernetes knows how to manage it because it has a predefined resource definition.
   - **Custom Resource (CR)**: A custom resource is a user-defined extension to Kubernetes. It isn't built into Kubernetes by default. You create a custom resource using a **CRD (Custom Resource Definition)**, which acts as a blueprint for that resource.
   - **Comparison**: When creating a `Deployment`, Kubernetes uses its native resource definition to validate your YAML file. In the case of a custom resource, Kubernetes uses a **CRD** to validate the custom resource you’re creating.

### 2. **Step-by-Step Process for Custom Resource Creation and Validation**
   **Steps**:
   1. **Create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD)**:
      - Before you can create any custom resource, you first need to define it using a CRD. This defines what fields and options are available for that resource.
      - For example, in the case of Istio, the custom resource might be a `VirtualService`. The Istio CRD defines the structure for creating this `VirtualService`.

      **Command**:
```bash
      kubectl apply -f virtualservice-crd.yaml
```

      **Output**:
```bash
      customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/virtualservices.networking.istio.io created
```

      **Explanation**: This command creates the CRD on the Kubernetes cluster. It tells Kubernetes what a `VirtualService` is and how to validate it.

   2. **Create a Custom Resource (CR)**:
      - After the CRD is in place, a user can create an instance of the custom resource. For example, if the CRD is for `VirtualService`, a user can create a specific `VirtualService` instance for routing traffic within Istio.

      **Command**:
```bash
      kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```

      **Output**:
```bash
      virtualservice.networking.istio.io/my-virtualservice created
```

      **Explanation**: This command creates a custom resource `VirtualService` based on the CRD. The resource will be validated against the CRD to ensure it's correctly formatted.

   3. **Validation**:
      - Kubernetes validates the custom resource against the CRD definition. If the YAML file for the custom resource doesn't follow the rules defined in the CRD, Kubernetes will throw an error.

      **Scenario**:
      If you try to include an undefined field in the custom resource (e.g., `fieldXYZ`), Kubernetes will reject the resource creation because it doesn't match the CRD definition.

      **Error Example**:
```bash
      error: fieldXYZ is not a recognized field
```

### 3. **Custom Controller**
   - **Purpose**: A **Custom Controller** is a component that watches for the creation or changes in custom resources and takes action based on the desired state described in the custom resource. While Kubernetes has native controllers (like `DeploymentController`), for custom resources, you need a custom controller.
   - **Example**: In the case of Istio, the Istio custom controller watches for the creation of a `VirtualService` and applies the appropriate networking rules defined in the custom resource.

   **Comparison with Deployment**:
   - When you create a native resource like `Deployment`, Kubernetes' native controller ensures that the specified number of replicas are running by creating the necessary `Pods`.
   - In the case of a custom resource, like `VirtualService`, nothing will happen until a custom controller (e.g., Istio controller) watches for the resource and applies the necessary configuration.

### 4. **Deployment of Custom Controller**
   **Step 1: Deploy the CRD**:
   - The DevOps engineer first deploys the CRD for the custom resource, like the `VirtualService` CRD in Istio.

   **Step 2: Deploy the Custom Controller**:
   - The custom controller must also be deployed to watch for changes in the custom resource and take action accordingly.
   
   **Command to Deploy Custom Controller**:
```bash
   helm install istio-base istio/base
```

   **Explanation**: In this example, using Helm, the Istio custom controller is deployed onto the cluster. It will now watch for `VirtualService` resources and perform the required actions, like configuring traffic rules.

   **Scenario**:
   - **Without the Controller**: If you create a custom resource like `VirtualService` but no controller is deployed, nothing will happen. The custom resource will exist, but it won't take effect because there's no controller watching and acting on it.
   - **With the Controller**: Once the custom controller is deployed, it will continuously monitor the cluster for `VirtualService` resources and apply the traffic management rules described in the resource.

### 5. **Diagram Overview**:
   1. **Step 1 - CRD Deployment**: DevOps engineers deploy the CRD (e.g., `VirtualService`) using Helm, plain manifests, or operators.
   2. **Step 2 - Custom Resource Creation**: A user (DevOps engineer or developer) creates a custom resource (e.g., `VirtualService`) using the structure defined in the CRD.
   3. **Step 3 - Validation**: Kubernetes validates the custom resource against the CRD. If it is correct, the resource is accepted into the cluster.
   4. **Step 4 - Controller Action**: The custom controller monitors the cluster for the new custom resource and performs the necessary actions based on its configuration (e.g., traffic routing in Istio).

### Commands and Output Summary:
1. **Apply the CRD**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f virtualservice-crd.yaml
```
   **Output**: 
```bash
   customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/virtualservices.networking.istio.io created
```

2. **Create a Custom Resource (CR)**:
```bash
   kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
```
   **Output**:
```bash
   virtualservice.networking.istio.io/my-virtualservice created
```

3. **Check for Custom Resources**:
```bash
   kubectl get virtualservice
```
   **Output**:
```bash
   NAME                GATEWAYS        HOSTS                 AGE
   my-virtualservice   my-gateway      my-app.example.com    5m
```

4. **Deploy the Custom Controller**:
```bash
   helm install istio-base istio/base
```
   **Output**:
```bash
   NAME: istio-base
   LAST DEPLOYED: ...
   NAMESPACE: istio-system
```

### Conclusion:
- **CRD**: Extends Kubernetes by defining a new resource type.
- **CR**: An instance of that resource.
- **Custom Controller**: Automates actions based on the custom resource’s desired state, similar to Kubernetes' native controllers. If no controller is present, the custom resource will not result in any action.

To break down and explain each part of the provided Kubernetes concepts and instructions in detail, here is a step-by-step explanation, along with a comparison of native and custom resources, and the commands and processes involved:

### 1. **Comparison Between Native Kubernetes Resources and Custom Resources**
   - **Native Resource (Example: `deployment.yaml`)**:
     - When a user creates a native Kubernetes resource like a deployment (e.g., `deployment.yaml`), it goes through the Kubernetes API server and is validated against the Kubernetes resource definition (which is predefined by Kubernetes).
     - **Custom Resource (Example: `virtualservice.yaml`)**:
       - Similarly, when a user creates a custom resource like a `virtualservice.yaml`, it is validated against the Custom Resource Definition (CRD), which extends the Kubernetes API with custom behavior.

### 2. **Creating and Validating Custom Resources**
   - **User Submits Custom Resource (CR)**
     - After the user submits a Custom Resource (CR), Kubernetes validates the CR against the CRD (Custom Resource Definition). This is similar to how Kubernetes validates a native resource (like a deployment) against its predefined resource definition.

### 3. **Deployment Controllers in Native Resources**
   - **Native Resource Controllers**:
     - For native resources like a deployment, once validated, Kubernetes uses a deployment controller to manage the lifecycle of the resource. For example, it ensures the correct number of replicas are running by interacting with the ReplicaSet controller, which in turn creates and manages the pods.
   - **Custom Controllers for Custom Resources**:
     - For custom resources, after a CR is validated and created, it will not perform any actions on its own. A custom Kubernetes controller must be deployed to watch the custom resource and take actions. Without a custom controller, the custom resource will just exist without performing its intended functionality.

### 4. **Flow of Operations in Custom Resources**
   - **Step 1: Deploy the CRD (Custom Resource Definition)**:
     - A **DevOps Engineer** or an organization will deploy the CRD to Kubernetes, which is typically done by retrieving the CRD from documentation (e.g., Istio CRD) and deploying it.
     - CRDs can be deployed using:
       - Plain Kubernetes manifests.
       - Helm charts.
       - Kubernetes operators.
   - **Step 2: Create the Custom Resource**:
     - A **User** (such as a developer or DevOps engineer) creates a custom resource (CR), like a virtual service, by writing the required YAML file and submitting it to Kubernetes. The CR is validated against the CRD, and if valid, it gets deployed into the Kubernetes cluster.
     - Example: A user creates a virtual service in the `Abhishek` namespace.
   - **Step 3: Deploy the Custom Controller**:
     - To make the custom resource functional, a **DevOps Engineer** must deploy a custom controller. The custom controller watches the custom resource (CR) and performs the required action.
     - The custom controller can be deployed using Helm charts, plain manifests, or Kubernetes operators, similar to CRDs.

### 5. **Understanding Custom Controllers**
   - **What Custom Controllers Do**:
     - Custom controllers monitor the state of a custom resource (CR) and take necessary actions. In the example of Istio, a virtual service CR is used to manage service mesh-related configurations like Mutual TLS (mTLS) and east-west traffic control.
     - Without a custom controller, the CR would be inactive—much like an Ingress resource without an Ingress controller.

### Commands and Outputs:

1. **Deploying a CRD**:
   - **Command**:
```bash
     kubectl apply -f <path-to-crd.yaml>
```
     - **Purpose**: This command applies the CRD to the Kubernetes cluster, making the new custom resource type available for creation. In this case, it would be something like the Istio virtual service CRD.

2. **Creating a Custom Resource**:
   - **Command**:
```bash
     kubectl apply -f <path-to-custom-resource.yaml> -n Abhishek
```
     - **Purpose**: This command creates a custom resource (e.g., Istio virtual service) inside the specified namespace (`Abhishek`). The resource will be validated against the CRD.

3. **Deploying a Custom Controller**:
   - **Command**:
```bash
     helm install istio-base istio/base -n istio-system
     helm install istio-istiod istio/istiod -n istio-system
```
     - **Purpose**: These commands install the Istio base and Istio controller (istiod) using Helm charts. The Istio controller will monitor and act on custom resources like virtual services.

### Real-World Scenario:

1. **Step 1: Deploy CRD**:
   A company decides to use Istio as a service mesh in their Kubernetes cluster. The DevOps team deploys the Istio virtual service CRD using Kubernetes manifests or Helm.

2. **Step 2: Create Custom Resource**:
   A developer working in the `Abhishek` namespace creates a virtual service custom resource. This custom resource defines routing rules for Istio.

3. **Step 3: Deploy Custom Controller**:
   To activate the virtual service, the DevOps team deploys the Istio controller. The controller watches for changes in virtual services and applies the appropriate networking configurations (like traffic routing and Mutual TLS).

### Conclusion:

By understanding the comparison between native and custom Kubernetes resources, along with how CRDs and custom controllers work, you can effectively extend Kubernetes to meet custom requirements. The commands demonstrate how to deploy and manage CRDs, custom resources, and controllers, ensuring your Kubernetes cluster can support additional functionalities like service mesh configurations (e.g., Istio).
