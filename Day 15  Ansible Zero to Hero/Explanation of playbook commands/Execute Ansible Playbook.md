The command `ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible_playbook.yml` is used to execute an Ansible playbook. Here's a breakdown of each component:

### **Command Breakdown:**

1. **`ansible-playbook`**
   - **Purpose:** This is the main command to run Ansible playbooks. It executes the instructions defined in a playbook file, which automates tasks on remote hosts.

2. **`-i inventory`**
   - **Purpose:** The `-i` flag specifies the inventory file that contains the list of hosts (servers) where the playbook will be applied.
   - **Explanation:** The `inventory` file could be a simple text file with hostnames or IP addresses, or it could be a more complex inventory script or a dynamic inventory source. This file tells Ansible which servers to connect to and manage.

3. **`ansible_playbook.yml`**
   - **Purpose:** This is the path to the playbook file that you want to execute.
   - **Explanation:** The `ansible_playbook.yml` file contains the tasks and instructions that Ansible will run on the specified hosts. It is written in YAML format and defines what needs to be done on the remote systems.

### **Putting It All Together:**
- **Command Execution:** When you run `ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible_playbook.yml`, Ansible uses the `inventory` file to determine which servers to target and then executes the tasks defined in the `ansible_playbook.yml` file on those servers.

### **Example:**
Suppose you have a playbook file `deploy_app.yml` that includes instructions to install and configure an application on your servers, and you have an inventory file `hosts.ini` that lists your servers.

To run the playbook on the servers listed in `hosts.ini`, you would use the following command:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini deploy_app.yml
```

- **`hosts.ini`**: Your inventory file listing all servers to manage.
- **`deploy_app.yml`**: Your playbook file with the tasks to execute.

### **Summary:**
- **`ansible-playbook`** runs your playbook.
- **`-i inventory`** specifies which servers to target.
- **`ansible_playbook.yml`** is the file containing the tasks to perform.

This command helps automate configuration and deployment tasks across multiple servers efficiently.
