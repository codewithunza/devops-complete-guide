### **1. Introduction to Jenkins Pipelines**

In Jenkins, a **pipeline** is a series of automated steps (stages) that allow for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of software. The pipeline consists of different stages that can include Build, Test, and Deploy processes.

### **2. Building a Larger Jenkins Pipeline**

#### **Adding Stages to the Pipeline**

To create a more complex pipeline, you can simply keep adding stages as needed. Here is a breakdown of how to do this properly:

- **Example of Adding Stages**:
  ```groovy
  pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
          stage('Build') {
              steps {
                  // Build steps
                  echo 'Building...'
              }
          }
          stage('Test') {
              steps {
                  // Test steps
                  echo 'Testing...'
              }
          }
          stage('Deploy') {
              steps {
                  // Deployment step
                  sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml'
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - Each `stage` encapsulates a set of steps relevant to that phase of your CI/CD workflow.
  - The `Deploy` stage uses a command that applies Kubernetes configurations from `deployment.yaml`. 

#### **Purpose**:
The purpose of a multi-stage pipeline is to logically separate the CI/CD processes. Each stage can target specific aspects of application management: building code, running tests, and deploying the application.

### **3. Multi-Stage and Multi-Agent Pipeline**

**Multi-stage** pipelines execute various sequential tasks, while **multi-agent** pipelines allow stages to run on different agents or environments tailored to specific needs.

#### **Scenario Overview**

In your organization, you might have:

- A **frontend application** running on Node.js.
- A **backend application** built with Java, possibly using Maven.
- A **database layer** requiring either MySQL or Oracle on a different platform.

**Example Pipeline Structure**:
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none // Specify a base agent for different stages
    stages {
        stage('Frontend') {
            agent {
                docker { image 'node:14' }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'npm install' // Install frontend dependencies
                sh 'npm run build' // Build the frontend
            }
        }
        stage('Backend') {
            agent {
                docker { image 'maven:3.6.3-jdk-8' }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install' // Build the backend
            }
        }
        stage('Database') {
            agent {
                docker { image 'mysql:latest' }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT * FROM my_table;"' // Query example
                // Also would run migrations or seed the database here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Explanation**:
- Each stage runs in a different Docker container specified by the `agent` directive. For instance, the frontend runs on a Node.js container, while the backend runs on a Maven container.
- Using Docker ensures that the environmental dependencies are managed accurately for each component.

### **4. Container Management in Jenkins**

**Dynamic Creation and Management of Containers**

When you run your pipeline:
- Jenkins creates containers dynamically for each stage specified in the pipeline.
- These containers isolate the processes from one another, ensuring that dependencies do not clash.

#### **Command Explanation**:
1. **View Running Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   - **Output**: Lists all active Docker containers.
   - **Use Case**: Check which containers are currently running after executing your Jenkins pipeline.

2. **Stop and Remove Containers**:
   After the pipeline execution is complete, Docker containers are automatically cleaned up. However, if you want to manually remove containers, you would use:
   ```bash
   docker rm <container_id>
   ```

#### **Purpose**:
Containers are ephemeral; they are created when needed and destroyed afterward, saving system resources and minimizing overhead.

### **5. Executing Database Commands**

Inside your database stage:
- You might want to run SQL commands or scripts, as shown in this SQL command structure:
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT * FROM my_table;"
```
- This command connects to a MySQL database and executes a SQL query.

#### **Explanation**:
- **-u root**: Specifies the username.
- **-p**: Prompts for the password.
- **-e**: Indicates that the following string is a command to execute.

### **6. Pipeline Flexibility and Adaptation**

You can adapt the provided pipeline as needed:
- Change the version of Maven or Node.js in the configuration, or update database images according to the requirements.
- Replace the applications' content with simple examples (like a "Hello World" Java application or a basic Node.js app) for testing purposes.

### **7. Running the Pipeline**

Once your pipeline is defined, you can trigger it:
- Upon execution, expect two or more containers created for each defined stage.
- Monitor the creation of these containers in real-time using `docker ps` or in the Jenkins console output.

### **Conclusion**

By structuring your Jenkins pipeline with distinct stages and agents tailored for specific technologies, you create an efficient CI/CD workflow appropriate for multi-tier applications. Each stage operates in isolation, ensuring that dependencies don't conflict and that the overall process scales well.

This structured approach leverages Docker’s capabilities, improves resource management, and simplifies the CI/CD process, making it easier to manage complex applications.
